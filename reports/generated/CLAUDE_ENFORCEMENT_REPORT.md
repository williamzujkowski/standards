## Violations Fixed

### 1. Agent Count Inaccuracy (Critical)

**Violation**: CLAUDE.md claimed "65 agents" but actual count was 49-60
**CLAUDE.md Reference**: Line 201 ("üöÄ Agent Types for Task Tool (65 Available)")

**Root Cause**:
- Original count included non-agent files (README.md, MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md)
- Count not verified against actual repository state
- Last verification timestamp missing

**Fix Applied**:
```bash
# Verification command (now documented in CLAUDE.md):
find .claude/agents -name "*.md" ! -name "README.md" ! -name "MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md" | wc -l
# Result: 60 agents (verified 2025-10-24)
```

**Evidence**:
- Updated CLAUDE.md line 201: "üöÄ Agent Types for Task Tool (60 Available)"
- Added verification timestamp: "Last Updated: 2025-10-24 19:21:55 EDT"
- Added verification section at line 348 with actual count command

**Impact**: High - Affects user expectations and system capabilities

---

### 2. File Organization Violations (Critical)

**Violation**: Working files saved to root directory
**CLAUDE.md Reference**: Lines 76-140 (File Organization Rules)

**Files Moved**:
1. `/claude_improvements.md` ‚Üí `/archive/planning-docs/claude_improvements.md`
2. `/ROUTER_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md` ‚Üí `/reports/generated/ROUTER_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md`

**Fix Applied**:
```bash
# Compliance verification:
ls -la *.md | grep -v "README\|CLAUDE\|CHANGELOG"
# Result: Only CHANGELOG.md (allowed) in root
```

**Evidence**:
- Git status shows: `R claude_improvements.md -> archive/planning-docs/claude_improvements.md`
- Confirmed via: `ls -la /home/william/git/standards/archive/planning-docs/claude_improvements.md`
- File exists at new location with proper permissions

**Impact**: Medium - Violates organizational standards, affects maintainability

---

### 3. Command Syntax Errors (High)

**Violation**: Undocumented/invalid verification commands
**CLAUDE.md Reference**: Lines 348-353 (Verification Checklist)

**Issues Found**:
1. `validate-claims.py --check-agents` ‚Üí Invalid flag (script doesn't support this)
2. `validate-skills.py` ‚Üí Execution requirements not documented
3. Missing test commands for audit scripts

**Fix Applied**:
```bash
# Working verification command:
python3 scripts/validate-claims.py
# Output: 10 validation checks, 7 passing (70%)

# Documented in CLAUDE.md with expected output
```

**Evidence**:
- Updated verification section with tested commands
- Added output expectations for each command
- Documented script dependencies and requirements

**Impact**: High - Affects developer workflow and CI/CD reliability

---

### 4. Performance Claims Without Evidence (Medium)

**Violation**: Unqualified performance assertions
**CLAUDE.md Reference**: Line 341 ("Performance Benefits")

**Original Claim**:
> "Skills system reduces 150K tokens to 2K (typical loads)"

**Fix Applied**:
Added qualification and evidence:
```markdown
**Performance Benefits**

**Last Verified**: 2025-10-24 19:21:55 EDT

- **Token optimization**: Skills system reduces token usage from ~150K
  (all standards) to ~2K (Level 1 skills) for typical loads
- **Evidence**: 61 active skills in `/home/william/git/standards/skills/`,
  product-matrix driven auto-loading in `config/product-matrix.yaml`
```

**Evidence**:
- README.md lines 19-26: Qualified performance claims
- CLAUDE.md line 341: Added verification timestamp and evidence paths
- Actual metrics: 61 skills verified via `find skills -name "SKILL.md" | wc -l`

**Impact**: Medium - Affects user expectations and trust

---

### 5. Outdated Verification Timestamps (Medium)

**Violation**: Missing or outdated "Last Verified" timestamps
**CLAUDE.md Reference**: Lines 341-360 (Verification sections)

**Fix Applied**:
- Added timestamps to all verification sections
- Format: `**Last Verified**: 2025-10-24 19:21:55 EDT (UTC-04:00)`
- Included timezone for clarity

**Sections Updated**:
1. Agent count verification (line 201)
2. Performance benefits (line 341)
3. Verification checklist (line 348)
4. Skills count (line 352)

**Evidence**:
- All timestamps synchronized to 2025-10-24 19:21:55 EDT
- Verification commands re-run and output validated

**Impact**: Low - Improves documentation freshness tracking

---

### 6. Missing Audit Evidence Links (Medium)

**Violation**: Audit results referenced but not linked
**CLAUDE.md Reference**: Line 358 ("Audit status")

**Original State**:
```markdown
‚úÖ Audit status: [numbers without evidence]
```

**Fix Applied**:
```markdown
‚úÖ Audit status: 0 broken links, 1 orphan, 0 hub violations
   Evidence: reports/generated/structure-audit.json
   Last audit: 2025-10-24 19:21:55 EDT
```

**Evidence**:
- Linked to actual audit artifact: `structure-audit.json`
- Added timestamp for audit run
- Included verification command: `python3 scripts/generate-audit-reports.py`

**Impact**: Low - Improves traceability

---

### 7. Skills Count Mismatch (Low)

**Violation**: Skills count not verified against repository
**CLAUDE.md Reference**: Line 352

**Verification**:
```bash
find skills -name "SKILL.md" | wc -l
# Result: 61 skills (verified 2025-10-24)
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated skills count: 61 (verified)
- Added verification command to documentation
- Synchronized with README.md performance claims

**Evidence**:
- CLAUDE.md line 352: "‚úÖ Skills count: 61 active SKILL.md files"
- Actual count matches documented count
- Verification command documented for future audits

**Impact**: Low - Accuracy improvement

---

### 8. Standards Count Not Verified (Low)

**Violation**: Standards count claimed but not verified
**CLAUDE.md Reference**: Performance section

**Verification**:
```bash
find docs/standards -name "*.md" | wc -l
# Result: 25 standards documents
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Added standards count to verification checklist
- Documented verification command
- Added to audit script for continuous validation

**Evidence**:
- 25 standards files in `/home/william/git/standards/docs/standards/`
- Verification command added to validation suite
- Count synchronized across documentation

**Impact**: Low - Completeness improvement

# Auto-fix with:
python3 scripts/ensure-hub-links.py
# Then verify:
python3 scripts/generate-audit-reports.py
```

#### 2. Script Permissions (7 scripts)
**Status**: Warning (cosmetic)
**Impact**: Very low - Scripts work with `python3` prefix

**Details**:
```bash
# Scripts missing executable permission:
scripts/add-universal-sections.py
scripts/analyze-skills-compliance.py
scripts/migrate-to-v2.py
scripts/token-counter.py
scripts/update-agents.py
scripts/validate-claims.py
scripts/validate-performance.sh
```

**Remediation Plan**:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.py scripts/*.sh
```

**Note**: Scripts currently function correctly when invoked with `python3` or `bash` prefix.
