# Pull Request: Standards Router + Kickstart Alignment, Product Matrix, and NIST Path Tightening

**Date:** 2025-08-23  
**Branch:** 2025-08-22  
**Target:** master

## üìã Summary

This PR implements comprehensive improvements to the standards repository, focusing on three key areas:

1. **Standards Router Integration**: Enhanced CLAUDE.md with fast-path loading and product matrix support
2. **Product Type Auto-Mapping**: Created intelligent mapping from product types to curated standard bundles
3. **NIST r5 Pathway**: Tightened compliance pathway with working examples and validation

## üéØ Key Achievements

### ‚úÖ Phase 0: Discovery
- Generated comprehensive standards inventory (46 documents)
- Created normalized catalog with codes, tags, and relationships
- Output: `reports/generated/standards-inventory.json`

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Product Matrix
- Created `config/product-matrix.yaml` with 10 product types
- Implemented wildcard expansion (SEC:*, TS:*, etc.)
- Added language and framework auto-detection
- Documentation: `docs/guides/USING_PRODUCT_MATRIX.md`

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Kickstart & Router Alignment
- Updated KICKSTART_PROMPT.md with router integration
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with fast-path loading
- Added routing contracts and processing pipeline

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: NIST r5 Tightening
- Verified and enhanced setup-nist-hooks.sh
- Created working quickstart example with 14 NIST controls
- Added comprehensive validation guide
- Output: `examples/nist-templates/quickstart/`

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Quality Gates
- Generated link and structure audit reports
- Created comprehensive CI/CD validation workflow
- Added automated compliance checking

## üîç Verification Guide

### Local Verification

#### 1. Test Standards Inventory
```bash
python3 scripts/generate-standards-inventory.py
cat reports/generated/standards-inventory.json | jq '.summary'
```
Expected: 46 standards, 37 categories

#### 2. Test Product Matrix
```bash
# Validate YAML structure
cat config/product-matrix.yaml | head -20

# Check product definitions
grep "^  [a-z-]*:" config/product-matrix.yaml | wc -l
```
Expected: 10 product types defined

#### 3. Test NIST Quickstart
```bash
cd examples/nist-templates/quickstart
make validate
```
Expected: All checks pass

#### 4. Test NIST Hooks
```bash
./scripts/setup-nist-hooks.sh
# Create test commit to trigger hook
```
Expected: Hook runs and checks for tags

#### 5. Run Audit Reports
```bash
python3 scripts/generate-audit-reports.py
ls -la reports/generated/
```
Expected: linkcheck.txt and structure-audit.md generated

### CI Verification

The new workflow `.github/workflows/lint-and-validate.yml` will automatically:

1. Run pre-commit checks
2. Lint Markdown and YAML
3. Check links
4. Audit structure
5. Validate NIST quickstart
6. Check standards inventory
7. Validate product matrix
8. Check NIST compliance in PRs
