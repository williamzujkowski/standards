## Critical Gaps

### 1. Two Skills Outstanding (25%)

- **Authentication Security:** OAuth 2.0, JWT, MFA implementation
- **React Frontend:** Hooks, state management, component patterns

**Estimated Time to Complete:** 3 days (1.5 days each)

### 2. Bundled Resources Missing (0/37 files)

All 6 completed skills reference templates, configs, and scripts that don't exist:

- TypeScript: 6 files (configs, templates, scripts)
- CI/CD: 5 files (workflow templates, deployment scripts)
- Secrets Management: 7 files (vault config, rotation scripts)
- Kubernetes: 7 files (K8s manifests, Helm charts)
- Unit Testing: 6 files (test templates, coverage configs)
- Integration Testing: 6 files (Docker Compose, API test templates)

**Total Missing:** 37 bundled resource files

   - NIST IA-2, IA-5 mappings
   - Create 6 bundled resources

2. **Complete React Frontend Skill** (Day 2-3)
   - Hooks patterns, component composition
   - State management, testing with RTL
   - Create 7 bundled resources

3. **Create All Bundled Resources** (Day 3)
   - 37 files across 6 completed skills
   - Templates, configs, scripts for each skill

### Short-Term (Week 2)

4. **Final Validation Pass**
   - Re-run all integration tests
   - Verify cross-references
   - Ensure 100% resource availability

## Value Delivered

### What Works Now ✅

- **6 production-ready skills** with excellent content
- **100% token compliance** for all completed work
- **High-quality examples** across Python, JavaScript, Go, TypeScript
- **Security-focused** with NIST control mappings
- **Modern tooling** (Docker, K8s, CI/CD, Testcontainers)

### Usage Scenarios

Users can immediately:

- ✅ Implement TypeScript projects with type safety
- ✅ Build CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
