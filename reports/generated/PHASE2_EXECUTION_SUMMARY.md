| **TOTAL** | **100%** | - | **65.0** | ❌ **FAIL** |

**Adjusted Score:** 35.1/100 (heavy penalty for missing Phase 2 content)

### Gate Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Phase 1 remediation | 100% | 100% | ✅ Met |
| Phase 2 skills created | 10 | 2 | ❌ 20% |
| Skills quality | >85/100 | 95/100 | ✅ Exceeds (for completed) |
| Token compliance | 100% <5k | 100% | ✅ Met |
| Script tests | >90% | 84.5% | ⚠️ 94% of target |
| Meta-skills | 2 functional | 2 | ✅ Met |
| Integration tests | 100% | 99% | ✅ Near perfect |

### Decision Matrix

**Thresholds:**
- 95-100%: **GO** (proceed immediately)
- 85-94%: **CONDITIONAL GO** (minor fixes)
- 75-84%: **NO-GO** (extend 2 days)
- <75%: **NO-GO** (extend 1-2 weeks, major blockers) ← **Current: 35.1%**

**Decision:** ❌ **NO-GO - EXTEND 2 WEEKS**

---

## ⚠️ Critical Issues

### Priority 0 Blockers

**P0-01: Phase 2 Content Missing** (BLOCKING)
- **Impact:** Critical - core objective unmet
- **Gap:** 8 of 10 skills not created
- **Effort:** 40 hours (5 hours per skill × 8)
- **Status:** ❌ Blocking gate approval

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Token constraints limited agent output
- Content creation more time-consuming than estimated
- Agents completed planning/remediation instead of content

**Mitigation:**
- Extend timeline by 2 weeks
- Prioritize content creation over documentation
- Use JavaScript/Go as templates (95/100 quality baseline)

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Phase 1 Remediation Excellence**
   - 100% completion rate
   - High quality (98/100)
   - All gaps addressed systematically

2. **Meta-Skills Implementation**
   - Legacy-bridge enables seamless migration
   - Skill-loader provides powerful CLI
   - Zero breaking changes for users

3. **Quality of Completed Skills**
   - JavaScript: 95/100 (exemplary)
   - Go: 95/100 (exemplary)
   - Established strong template pattern

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Excellent planning documents
   - Thorough quality reports
   - Clear gate criteria

### Challenges & Root Causes

1. **Content Creation Underestimated**
   - **Estimate:** 5h per skill
   - **Actual:** ~10-15h per skill (with bundled resources)
   - **Impact:** Only 20% completed

2. **Token Constraints**
   - Agents spent 116k tokens (58% of budget)
   - Limited concurrent skill creation
   - Planning consumed more tokens than expected

3. **Scope Prioritization**
   - Agents completed remediation first (correct)
   - Then completed planning/documentation (important)
   - But ran out of capacity for content (critical gap)

4. **Sequential Dependencies**
   - Some agents waited for others
   - Could have started content creation earlier
   - Better task parallelization needed
