---

## 📊 TOKEN BUDGET ANALYSIS

### Budget Compliance

- **Skills exceeding budget:** 40/61 (65.6%)
- **Skills within budget:** 21/61 (34.4%)

### Top Token Violators (need refactoring)

| Skill | Total | L1 | L2 | L3 | Issue |
|-------|-------|----|----|----|----|
| healthtech | 8,260 | 0 | **6,346** | 0 | L2 too large |
| advanced-kubernetes | 6,767 | 0 | **3,099** | 0 | L2 too large |
| fintech | 6,214 | 0 | **3,504** | 0 | L2 too large |
| authorization | 5,969 | **317** | 321 | **276** | All levels over |
| shell | 5,686 | 0 | 18 | 0 | Content elsewhere |

**Recommendation:** Extract large L2 sections to separate files, move to L3 references.

---

## 🧪 TEST SUITE STATUS

### Overall: ⚠️ STABLE AT 87.7%

**Test Execution:**

- Total Tests: 457
- Passed: 401 (87.7%)
- Failed: 56 (12.3%)
- Skipped: 17

### Critical Test Failures (BLOCKING)

#### 1. SkillLoader Path Type Error 🔴 CRITICAL

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str'
Location: scripts/skill-loader.py line 51
```

**Impact:** Router cannot load skills by path
**Fix Required:** Accept both `Path` and `str` types
**Priority:** P0 - Blocks core functionality

#### 2. Cleanup Service Not Implemented

```
NotImplementedError: Implementation required
Location: tests/integration/test_cleanup.py
```

**Impact:** Test scaffolding exists, no implementation
**Priority:** P2 - Test improvement

#### 3. Gitignore Test False Positive

```
AssertionError: .gitignore should exclude .pyc files
```

**Reality:** .gitignore HAS `*.py[cod]` which covers `.pyc`
**Fix:** Update test expectations
**Priority:** P3 - Test correction

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (UNCHANGED)

### 1. Router Path Resolution - STILL BROKEN 🔴

**Problem:** SkillLoader type error prevents individual skill loading
**Evidence:**

```bash
$ python3 scripts/skill-loader.py load skill:coding-standards/python
⚠️  Could not load skill: skill:coding-standards/python
```

**Root Cause:** Line 51 expects Path, receives str
**Blockers:**

- Cannot test router with individual skills
- Product matrix routing at risk
- CLI syntax unclear

**Action Required:**

1. Fix type handling in SkillLoader.**init**
2. Add Path() wrapper around repo_root parameter
3. Test both `skill:X` and `X` syntax

### 2. **pycache** Pollution - UNCHANGED

**Problem:** 7+ **pycache** directories in git
**Location:**

- scripts/**pycache**/
- tests/**pycache**/
- tests/unit/**pycache**/
- tests/validation/**pycache**/
- tests/integration/**pycache**/
- tests/scripts/**pycache**/
- tests/skills/**pycache**/
- examples/nist-templates/quickstart/**pycache**/

**Fix Command:**

```bash
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec git rm -r --cached {} +
git commit -m "chore: remove __pycache__ from git tracking"
```
