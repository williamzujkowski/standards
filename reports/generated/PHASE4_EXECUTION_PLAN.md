## 📋 Enhanced Incremental Save Strategy

### Advanced Checkpoint Protocol

Building on Phase 2+3 success, Phase 4 adds multi-layer validation:

**Layer 1: Section-Level Checkpoints (Phase 2+3 pattern)**
```bash
cat >> SKILL.md << 'EOF'
[Level 1 content]
EOF
wc -l SKILL.md && echo "✓ L1 checkpoint"
```

**Layer 2: Compliance Validation (NEW for Phase 4)**
```bash
# For compliance skills, validate requirements coverage
python3 scripts/validate-compliance.py --skill fintech --standard PCI-DSS
```

**Layer 3: Cross-Skill Dependency Check (NEW)**
```bash
# Ensure advanced skills reference prerequisite skills correctly
python3 scripts/validate-dependencies.py --skill advanced-kubernetes
```

**Layer 4: Memory Persistence with Metrics**
```bash
# Store detailed metrics, not just completion status
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage {
  key: "skill-{name}-metrics",
  value: {
    "lines": 1234,
    "tokens": {"l1": 800, "l2": 4200, "l3": 600},
    "resources": 6,
    "compliance_controls": 78,
    "references": ["kubernetes", "security-practices"],
    "timestamp": "2025-10-17"
  }
}
```

### Rollback Strategy (NEW)

If checkpoint fails:
1. Preserve partial work in backup file
2. Restore from last successful checkpoint
3. Log failure reason in memory
4. Alert master coordinator for intervention
5. Retry from last checkpoint (max 3 attempts)

- **Validation:** Code examples must be runnable and tested
- **Acceptance:** 15% token overage allowed for Operators skill

**Risk 3: Platform-Specific Accuracy**
- **Mitigation:** Reference official AWS/database documentation
- **Validation:** Test all code examples in actual environments
- **Versioning:** Clearly specify platform versions (e.g., K8s 1.28+, AWS SDK v3)

**Risk 4: Cross-Skill Dependencies**
- **Mitigation:** Dependency validation script checks references
- **Validation:** Ensure prerequisite skills exist before referencing
- **Documentation:** Clear dependency tree in each skill's frontmatter
