## Quality Scoring Methodology

Each skill is evaluated across 5 dimensions (20 points each, 100 total):

1. **Structure (20 pts):** Progressive disclosure, YAML frontmatter, section completeness
2. **Content Quality (20 pts):** Clarity, actionability, depth, accuracy
3. **Code Examples (20 pts):** Working code, best practices, diversity, annotations
4. **Resources (20 pts):** Bundled templates, scripts, configs, documentation
5. **Cross-References (20 pts):** Valid links, related skills, NIST mappings (if applicable)

- Integration Testing Standards: Target 92-95/100

**Priority 3 (Week 5, Days 1-2): Infrastructure Skills**
- Kubernetes Cloud-Native: Target 92-95/100
- React Frontend: Target 92-95/100

### Phase 3: Validation & Refinement (Days 9-10)

1. Run full validation suite on all 8 skills
2. Address any quality gaps
3. Ensure all bundled resources present
4. Verify all cross-references
5. Final token optimization pass

**Target:** All 8 skills at 90+/100, average 92+/100
