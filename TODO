## üöÄ LLM-Optimized Usage (NEW)

### Token-Efficient Approach with CLAUDE.md

The repository now features an LLM-optimized approach that reduces token usage by 85%:

1. **CLAUDE.md as Router**: 
   - Acts as lightweight abstraction layer (223 lines vs 534 originally)
   - Provides index of all standards with 2-letter codes
   - Implements @load syntax for dynamic standard retrieval

2. **Dynamic Loading Pattern**:
   ```
   # Instead of loading all standards:
   @load [CS:style,arch + TS:core + SEC:auth]  # Load only what's needed
   ```

3. **Task-Based Templates**:
   - API Development: `@load [CS:api + SEC:api + TS:integration]`
   - Bug Fixes: `@load [TS:regression + CS:error-handling]`
   - Security Review: `@load [SEC:* + CS:security + TS:security]`

4. **Benefits**:
   - Initial context: ~500 tokens (vs ~5000+)
   - Per-request: Only loads relevant sections
   - No duplication between documents
   - Faster LLM responses and lower costs
