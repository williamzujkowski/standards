# Task Assignment: Create ML/AI Standards

**Task ID:** TASK-008
**Priority:** High
**Assigned:** 2025-01-20

## Objectives
1. Create comprehensive ML_AI_STANDARDS.md
2. Cover MLOps, model lifecycle, and deployment
3. Address AI ethics and bias considerations
4. Include practical implementation patterns
5. Follow existing standards format

## Required Sections
- MLOps Principles and Practices
- Model Development Lifecycle
- Data Pipeline Standards
- Model Versioning and Registry
- Training Infrastructure
- Model Serving and Deployment
- Monitoring and Drift Detection
- A/B Testing and Experimentation
- AI Ethics and Bias Mitigation
- Security and Privacy (model attacks, data privacy)
- LLM-Specific Standards

## Deliverables
1. Complete ML_AI_STANDARDS.md in /docs/standards/
2. Include examples for popular frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
3. Add implementation checklists
4. Reference existing standards (DE, SEC, TS)
5. Cover both traditional ML and modern LLM practices

## Expected Output Location
`/docs/standards/ML_AI_STANDARDS.md`
