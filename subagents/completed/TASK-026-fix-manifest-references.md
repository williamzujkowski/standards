# Task Assignment: Fix MANIFEST and Cross-References

**Task ID:** TASK-026
**Priority:** Medium
**Assigned:** 2025-01-20

## Issues to Fix

### 1. Missing Standards in MANIFEST.yaml
- **Issue:** New standards (DATABASE, MICROSERVICES, ML_AI) not included in MANIFEST.yaml
- **Solution:** Add proper entries for all three new standards with metadata

### 2. Cross-Reference Gaps
- **Issue:** Some unidirectional links and missing cross-references
- **Solution:** Add bidirectional links between related standards

### 3. Standards Index Updates

- **Solution:** Regenerate standards index and verify all sections are included

## Specific Actions
1. Update `config/MANIFEST.yaml` with new standards entries
2. Add cross-references between related standards documents
3. Regenerate standards index
4. Verify all links work correctly

## Testing Requirements
- Validate MANIFEST.yaml syntax
- Test cross-reference links work
- Verify standards index includes all content
- Check for any missing entries
