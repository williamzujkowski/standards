# Task Assignment: Script Execution Validation

**Task ID:** TASK-023
**Priority:** High
**Assigned:** 2025-01-20

## Objectives
1. Test all Python scripts execute correctly
2. Test all shell scripts run without errors
3. Verify all dependencies and imports work
4. Check script outputs are as expected
5. Validate permissions and execution environment

## Testing Approach
1. Test Python scripts with proper inputs
2. Execute shell scripts in safe mode
3. Check for runtime errors or exceptions
4. Verify script outputs and exit codes
5. Test edge cases and error handling

## Scripts to Validate

### Python Scripts
- All scripts in /scripts/ directory
- Test scripts in /tests/ directory
- Linting tools in /lint/ directory
- Example scripts in /examples/ directories

### Shell Scripts
- All .sh files in repository
- Setup and installation scripts
- CI/CD and automation scripts
- Utility and helper scripts

## Safety Requirements
- Use safe test inputs only
- Don't modify production files
- Capture outputs for analysis
- Report any security concerns
