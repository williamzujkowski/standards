**Task ID:** TASK-013
**Priority:** Medium
**Assigned:** 2025-01-20

## Objectives
1. Identify documents over 300 lines that need TL;DR sections
2. Add concise TL;DR sections at the top of these documents
3. Ensure TL;DR captures the essence in 3-5 bullet points
4. Maintain document flow and structure

## Documents to Update
Based on analysis, these documents need TL;DR sections:
1. CLAUDE.md (643 lines) - Most critical
2. Any other standards documents over 400 lines
3. Long guide documents

## TL;DR Format
Place after the header metadata but before main content:
```markdown
## TL;DR
- Key point 1 (most important feature/concept)
- Key point 2 (primary use case)
- Key point 3 (main benefit)
- Key point 4 (quick start info)
```

## Guidelines
- Keep each bullet point to one line
- Focus on what users need to know immediately
- Include the most practical/actionable information
- Reference where to find more details

## Expected Output
Updated documents with TL;DR sections added appropriately.
