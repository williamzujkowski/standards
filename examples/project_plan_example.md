# Example Project Plan: Task Management API

## Project Overview

Building a modern task management API with real-time updates and team collaboration features.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- User registration and authentication
- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Task assignment to team members
- Real-time notifications for task updates
- Task comments and activity feed
- File attachments for tasks
- Task prioritization and categorization

- **Framework**: FastAPI (open to alternatives)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis cache
- **Hosting**: AWS or similar cloud provider
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Response time: < 200ms for API calls
- Uptime: 99.9% availability
- Security: OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Scalability: Support 10,000 concurrent users
- Testing: > 85% code coverage
- Documentation: API docs and developer guide

## Team & Timeline

- Team size: 3 developers
- Timeline: MVP in 4 weeks, production in 8 weeks
- Experience level: Intermediate

## Special Considerations
