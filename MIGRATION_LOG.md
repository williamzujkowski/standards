# Jekyll to MkDocs Migration Log

## Migration Summary
**Date:** August 24, 2025  
**Migration:** Jekyll → MkDocs with Material theme  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## What Was Removed
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` (Jekyll deployment workflow)
- `docs/Gemfile` and `docs/Gemfile.local` (Ruby dependencies)
- `docs/_config.yml` (Jekyll configuration)
- `docs/_includes/` directory (Jekyll includes)
- `docs/_layouts/` directory (Jekyll templates)
- `docs/assets/` directory (Jekyll assets/styles)
- `docs/index.md` (Jekyll-specific index)
- `docs/search.json` (Jekyll search configuration)
- `tests/validate-pages.spec.js` (Jekyll validation test)

## What Was Added
- `mkdocs.yml` - MkDocs configuration with Material theme
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for MkDocs
- `.github/workflows/deploy-mkdocs.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for MkDocs

## Migration Benefits
1. **Modern Documentation Platform**: MkDocs Material theme provides a more modern and responsive design
2. **Better Navigation**: Enhanced navigation with tabs, sections, and better mobile support
3. **Python Ecosystem**: Leverages Python tools and plugins instead of Ruby/Jekyll
4. **Simplified Maintenance**: Fewer dependencies and configuration files
5. **No Template Conflicts**: No more issues with `{% raw %}` tags in documentation

## Key Configuration Features
- Material theme with light/dark mode toggle
- Enhanced search functionality
- Git revision dates for documentation
- Code syntax highlighting with copy functionality
- Mobile-responsive navigation
- Comprehensive markdown extensions

## Build Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build documentation
mkdocs build

# Serve locally for development
mkdocs serve

# Build with strict mode (fail on warnings)
mkdocs build --strict
```

## Navigation Structure Preserved
The existing documentation structure in `/docs` is preserved with the same file organization:
- `/docs/core/` - Core documentation 
- `/docs/standards/` - Standards documentation
- `/docs/guides/` - User guides
- `/docs/nist/` - NIST compliance documentation

## Deployment
GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on pushes to the master branch.

## Notes
- Some external links to files outside `/docs` now show as warnings but still function
- The macros plugin was removed to avoid template syntax conflicts
- All existing markdown files remain unchanged and functional
