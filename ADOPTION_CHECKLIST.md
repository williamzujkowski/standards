- [ ] Optimize build process
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals

### Documentation
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Write deployment guide
- [ ] Document architecture decisions
- [ ] Create onboarding guide
- [ ] Set up changelog

## üéØ Week 4: Specialization

### Choose Your Focus Areas

#### For Web Applications
- [ ] Implement `SEO_WEB_MARKETING_STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] Set up `FRONTEND_MOBILE_STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] Configure `WEB_DESIGN_UX_STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] Add accessibility testing

#### for APIs/Backend
- [ ] Implement `EVENT_DRIVEN_STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] Configure `DATA_ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] Set up `CLOUD_NATIVE_STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] Add API versioning
- [ ] Tag all security endpoints with NIST controls

#### For DevOps Focus
- [ ] Implement `DEVOPS_PLATFORM_STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] Configure `OBSERVABILITY_STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] Set up `COST_OPTIMIZATION_STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] Automate everything

## üîÑ Ongoing: Continuous Improvement

### Monthly Reviews
- [ ] Review standards compliance
- [ ] Update metrics dashboard
- [ ] Check NIST control coverage
- [ ] Gather team feedback
- [ ] Plan improvements
- [ ] Update documentation

### Quarterly Activities
- [ ] Full standards audit
- [ ] Update to latest standards
- [ ] Team training session
- [ ] Process refinement
- [ ] Celebrate achievements

## üìä Tracking Progress

### Metrics to Monitor

| Week | Focus | Target Metrics |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Setup | All tools installed, CI running |
| 2 | Quality | 50%+ test coverage, linting passing |
| 3 | Operations | Monitoring active, <5% error rate |
| 4 | Specialization | Domain standards implemented |
| Ongoing | All | 85%+ coverage, A+ security, <200ms response |

### Success Indicators

**Green Flags üü¢**
- Automated checks passing
- Team adopting practices
- Metrics improving
- Fewer production issues

**Warning Signs üü°**
- Skipping tests to meet deadlines
- Ignoring linting errors
- Manual processes creeping in
- Standards becoming blockers

**Red Flags üî¥**
- No tests for new features
- Security scans failing
- Team resistance
- Metrics declining

## üéâ Completion Celebration

When you've implemented the core standards:

1. **Generate Badges**: Run `./generate-badges.sh`
2. **Create Report**: Use compliance report template
3. **Share Success**: Post about your achievement
4. **Help Others**: Contribute improvements back

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Don't try to implement everything at once
2. **Automate Early**: Set up automation before habits form
3. **Measure Progress**: You can't improve what you don't measure
4. **Get Buy-in**: Involve the team in decisions
5. **Iterate**: Standards should evolve with your needs

## üÜò Getting Help

- **Questions**: Create an issue in the standards repo
- **Examples**: Check the `examples/project-templates/` directory
- **Integration**: See `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- **Updates**: Watch the repository for updates
