# OWASP API Security Top 10 2023

## Overview

The OWASP API Security Top 10 2023 represents the most critical API security risks. APIs are core to modern applications, and this list helps organizations identify and mitigate the most severe API vulnerabilities.

## The Top 10 API Security Risks (2023)

### API1:2023 - Broken Object Level Authorization

APIs tend to expose endpoints that handle object identifiers, creating a wide attack surface for access control issues.

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Authorization checks MUST validate user permissions for every function
- User policies and hierarchy MUST be enforced

### API2:2023 - Broken Authentication

Authentication mechanisms implemented incorrectly allow attackers to compromise authentication tokens or exploit implementation flaws.

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Authentication mechanisms MUST be implemented correctly
- Multi-factor authentication SHOULD be required
- Rate limiting MUST be implemented on authentication endpoints

### API3:2023 - Broken Object Property Level Authorization

Lack of or improper authorization at the object property level leads to information exposure or manipulation.

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Validate user access to object properties
- Return only required properties
- Implement schema-based response validation

### API4:2023 - Unrestricted Resource Consumption

APIs not limiting size or number of resources can lead to DoS and performance issues.

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Rate limiting MUST be implemented
- Payload size limits MUST be enforced
- Query complexity limits MUST be defined

### API5:2023 - Broken Function Level Authorization

Complex access control policies lead to authorization flaws at the function level.

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Deny all access by default
- Authorization MUST be checked for every function
- Administrative functions MUST be isolated

### API6:2023 - Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows

APIs exposing business flows without considering excessive use can harm the business.

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Business flow limits MUST be implemented
- Device fingerprinting SHOULD be used
- Human interaction SHOULD be validated

### API7:2023 - Server Side Request Forgery

SSRF flaws occur when an API fetches remote resources without validating user-supplied URLs.

**Prevention Requirements:**

- URL input MUST be validated and sanitized
- URL schemas and ports MUST be restricted
- Network segmentation MUST be implemented

### API8:2023 - Security Misconfiguration

APIs and supporting systems with missing or improper security configuration.

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Security headers MUST be configured
- CORS MUST be properly configured
- Error messages MUST NOT expose sensitive information

### API9:2023 - Improper Inventory Management

Organizations lack proper API inventory and versioning, leading to exposed endpoints.

**Prevention Requirements:**

- API inventory MUST be maintained
- API versions MUST be tracked
- Deprecated APIs MUST be decommissioned

### API10:2023 - Unsafe Consumption of APIs

Developers trust third-party APIs more than user input, leading to weaker security controls.

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Third-party API data MUST be validated
- Security controls MUST apply to all data sources
- API communication MUST be encrypted

## Implementation Guidance

Organizations MUST:

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all input regardless of source
- Maintain comprehensive API inventory
- Monitor API usage and abuse

Organizations SHOULD:

- Adopt API security testing in CI/CD
- Implement API gateways
- Use schema validation
- Deploy Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
