# OWASP Top 10 2021 - Web Application Security Risks

## Overview

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document representing a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Organizations SHOULD adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their applications minimize these risks.

## The Top 10 Web Application Security Risks (2021)

### A01:2021 - Broken Access Control

**Moved up from #5** | 94% of applications tested had some form of broken access control

Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of data, or performing business functions outside user limits.

**Common Weaknesses:**

- Violation of the principle of least privilege
- Bypassing access control checks by modifying URL or API requests
- Viewing or editing someone else's account by providing unique identifier
- Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT, and DELETE
- Elevation of privilege
- CORS misconfiguration allows API access from unauthorized origins
- Force browsing to authenticated pages as unauthenticated user

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Access control MUST enforce by default
- Access control mechanisms MUST be centralized and reused
- Access MUST be denied by default
- Ownership records MUST be enforced
- Rate limiting MUST be implemented to minimize automated attacks
- Access tokens MUST be invalidated on logout

### A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures

**Previously #3 Sensitive Data Exposure** | Focused on failures related to cryptography

Failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof), which often lead to exposure of sensitive data. Common issues include use of weak cryptographic algorithms, poor key management, or transmission of data in clear text.

**Common Weaknesses:**

- Data transmitted in clear text (HTTP, SMTP, FTP)
- Sensitive data stored in clear text
- Old or weak cryptographic algorithms
- Default crypto keys in use, weak keys generated or reused
- Missing encryption enforcement
- Deprecated hash functions like MD5 or SHA1
- Improper use of padding modes

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Data MUST be classified according to sensitivity
- Sensitive data MUST NOT be stored unnecessarily
- Sensitive data at rest MUST be encrypted
- Strong algorithms and keys MUST be used (AES-256, RSA-2048 minimum)
- Keys MUST be properly managed and rotated
- Data in transit MUST use TLS 1.2 or higher
- Passwords MUST be stored using strong adaptive hashing (Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt)

### A03:2021 - Injection

**Down from #1** | 94% of applications were tested for injection

Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. Includes SQL, NoSQL, OS command, Object Relational Mapping (ORM), LDAP, and Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) injection.

**Common Weaknesses:**

- User-supplied data not validated, filtered, or sanitized
- Dynamic queries without parameterization
- Hostile data used within ORM search parameters
- Hostile data directly used or concatenated in SQL/commands
- Structured query languages used without escaping

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Input validation MUST be implemented using positive allowlisting
- Parameterized interfaces MUST be used for all database access
- Stored procedures MUST use parameterization
- Input MUST be escaped for dynamic queries
- LIMIT and other controls MUST be used to prevent mass disclosure

### A04:2021 - Insecure Design

**New Category** | Focus on risks related to design and architectural flaws

A new category focusing on risks related to design and architectural flaws, calling for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns, and reference architectures.

**Common Weaknesses:**

- Missing or ineffective control design
- Insecure design patterns
- Missing threat modeling
- Lack of secure development lifecycle
- Missing security requirements
- Insufficient security in user stories
- Lack of component-level security

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Secure development lifecycle MUST be established
- Threat modeling MUST be performed for critical functions
- Security patterns library MUST be used
- Security requirements MUST be integrated into user stories
- Plausibility checks MUST be implemented at each tier
- Unit and integration tests MUST validate security controls

### A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration

**Up from #6** | 90% of applications tested had some form of misconfiguration

The application might be vulnerable if it is missing appropriate security hardening or improperly configured permissions on cloud services, unnecessary features enabled, default accounts unchanged, error messages containing sensitive information, or security headers not set.

**Common Weaknesses:**

- Missing security hardening across application stack
- Unnecessary features enabled (ports, services, accounts)
- Default accounts with unchanged passwords
- Error handling reveals stack traces or sensitive information
- Latest security features disabled or not configured
- Security headers not set to secure values
- Software out of date or vulnerable

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Repeatable hardening process MUST be implemented
- Minimal platform MUST be used without unnecessary features
- Security notes MUST be reviewed and applied
- Automated verification process MUST check configurations
- Segmented architecture MUST provide separation between components
- Security directives MUST be sent to clients (Security Headers)
- Automated process MUST verify effectiveness of settings

### A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components

**Previously #9 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities** | #2 in community survey

You are vulnerable if you don't know the versions of all components, if software is vulnerable or unsupported, if you don't scan regularly, if you don't fix or upgrade in a timely fashion, or if developers don't test compatibility of updated libraries.

**Common Weaknesses:**

- Unknown versions of components in use
- Vulnerable, unsupported, or out-of-date software
- Irregular vulnerability scanning
- Delayed patching or upgrading
- Untested compatibility of updated libraries
- Unsecured component configurations

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Component inventory MUST be maintained
- Continuous monitoring MUST track component vulnerabilities
- Components MUST be obtained from official sources
- Unused dependencies MUST be removed
- Patching process MUST be established
- Component security MUST be continuously monitored

### A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures

**Previously #2 Broken Authentication** | Related to failures in identity confirmation

Confirmation of user identity, authentication, and session management is critical. Application may be vulnerable if it permits automated attacks, allows brute force, uses default or weak passwords, has weak credential recovery, stores passwords in plain text, or lacks multi-factor authentication.

**Common Weaknesses:**

- Permits automated attacks like credential stuffing
- Allows default, weak, or well-known passwords
- Uses weak credential recovery processes
- Stores passwords in plain text or weakly hashed
- Missing or ineffective multi-factor authentication
- Exposes session identifier in URL
- Doesn't properly invalidate sessions

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Multi-factor authentication MUST be implemented
- Default credentials MUST NOT be deployed
- Password checks MUST prevent weak passwords
- Password recovery MUST be secure
- Session management MUST use secure session managers
- Session identifiers MUST NOT appear in URLs
- Sessions MUST timeout and be invalidated properly

### A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures

**New Category** | Focuses on integrity assumptions

A new category focusing on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity. Includes insecure deserialization (from 2017 Top 10).

**Common Weaknesses:**

- Unsigned or unverified auto-updates
- Insecure CI/CD pipelines
- Untrusted sources for dependencies
- Insecure deserialization
- Missing integrity verification
- Unsigned or unencrypted serialized data

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Digital signatures MUST verify software and data
- Libraries and dependencies MUST come from trusted repositories
- Software supply chain security tool MUST be used
- CI/CD pipeline MUST have proper segregation and access control
- Unsigned serialized data MUST NOT be sent to untrusted clients
- Integrity checks MUST detect tampering

### A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

**Previously #10 Insufficient Logging & Monitoring** | Expanded to include more failures

Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected. Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and active response occurs any time auditable events are not logged, logs are only stored locally, or appropriate alerting thresholds don't exist.

**Common Weaknesses:**

- Auditable events not logged (logins, failures, high-value transactions)
- Warnings and errors generate inadequate or unclear log messages
- Logs not monitored for suspicious activity
- Logs only stored locally
- No alerting thresholds or response escalation
- Security testing doesn't trigger alerts
- No real-time or near-real-time detection capability

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Login, access control, and input validation failures MUST be logged
- Logs MUST be generated in format for log management solutions
- Log data MUST be encoded correctly
- High-value transactions MUST have audit trails
- Monitoring and alerting MUST enable timely response
- Incident response plan MUST be established and tested
- Log integrity MUST be protected against tampering

### A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**New Category** | Added from community survey

SSRF flaws occur when a web application fetches a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send crafted requests to unexpected destinations.

**Common Weaknesses:**

- URL provided by user not validated
- Fetching remote resources without validation
- Missing authentication on internal services
- Non-HTTP services accessible
- URL parser discrepancies
- Inconsistent URL validation

**Prevention Requirements:**

- Network layer MUST segment remote resource access
- "Deny by default" firewall policies MUST be enforced
- URL schema, port, and destination MUST be validated
- URL redirects MUST NOT be followed
- Raw HTTP responses MUST NOT be sent to clients
- URL consistency MUST be enforced
- Network flows MUST be monitored for SSRF

## Implementation Guidance

Organizations MUST:

- Adopt a secure development lifecycle with security at each phase
- Perform threat modeling for critical authentication, access control, business logic, and key flows
- Integrate security into user stories and requirements
- Use automated tools to verify security controls
- Conduct regular security testing including SAST, DAST, and penetration testing

Organizations SHOULD:

- Use the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)
- Implement the OWASP Proactive Controls
- Use OWASP Cheat Sheets for implementation guidance
- Adopt SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model) for process improvement

## Compliance and Testing

Security verification approaches:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Source code analysis
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Running application testing
- **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**: Runtime instrumentation
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Component vulnerability scanning
- **Penetration Testing**: Manual security assessment
