# NIST SP 800-218 - Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) v1.1

## Overview

The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) is a set of fundamental, sound, and secure software development practices based on established standards, guidance, and best practices. It helps organizations reduce the risk of software vulnerabilities and improve their ability to respond when vulnerabilities are discovered.

## Key SSDF Practice Groups

### PO: Prepare the Organization

Organizations MUST ensure that people, processes, and technology are prepared to perform secure software development.

#### PO.1: Define Security Requirements for Software Development

**Requirements:**

- **PO.1.1**: Establish security requirements for the organization's software development infrastructure
- **PO.1.2**: Establish security requirements for the organization's software development processes
- **PO.1.3**: Establish security requirements for the organization's developed software

**Implementation MUST include:**

- Risk-based security requirements
- Compliance with applicable regulations
- Security baselines for different software types

#### PO.2: Implement Roles and Responsibilities

**Requirements:**

- **PO.2.1**: Define roles and responsibilities for secure software development
- **PO.2.2**: Provide role-specific training
- **PO.2.3**: Ensure adequate staffing for security roles

**Organizations MUST:**

- Assign security champions
- Define security responsibilities in job descriptions
- Establish accountability mechanisms

#### PO.3: Implement Supporting Technology

**Requirements:**

- **PO.3.1**: Use automation for consistent security practices
- **PO.3.2**: Use tools for security analysis and testing
- **PO.3.3**: Maintain secure development environments

**Tools SHOULD include:**

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
- Security orchestration platforms

### PS: Protect Software

Organizations MUST protect all components of software from tampering and unauthorized access.

#### PS.1: Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access

**Requirements:**

- **PS.1.1**: Store code in secure repositories
- **PS.1.2**: Implement access controls for code repositories
- **PS.1.3**: Protect code integrity throughout the lifecycle

**Security controls MUST include:**

- Multi-factor authentication for repository access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging of all access
- Code signing and verification

#### PS.2: Provide a Mechanism for Verifying Software Release Integrity

**Requirements:**

- **PS.2.1**: Sign software releases
- **PS.2.2**: Provide verification instructions
- **PS.2.3**: Maintain signing key security

**Organizations MUST:**

- Use cryptographic signatures for releases
- Publish checksums and signatures
- Protect signing infrastructure
- Document verification procedures

#### PS.3: Archive and Protect Each Software Release

**Requirements:**

- **PS.3.1**: Maintain release archives
- **PS.3.2**: Protect archive integrity
- **PS.3.3**: Control archive access

### PW: Produce Well-Secured Software

Organizations MUST produce software with minimal vulnerabilities.

#### PW.1: Design Software to Meet Security Requirements

**Requirements:**

- **PW.1.1**: Apply secure design principles
- **PW.1.2**: Perform threat modeling
- **PW.1.3**: Implement defense-in-depth

**Design practices MUST include:**

- Least privilege principle
- Secure by default configurations
- Input validation strategies
- Secure communication protocols

#### PW.2: Review the Software Design to Verify Security Requirements

**Requirements:**

- **PW.2.1**: Conduct design reviews
- **PW.2.2**: Validate threat models
- **PW.2.3**: Document security decisions

#### PW.4: Reuse Existing Well-Secured Software

**Requirements:**

- **PW.4.1**: Evaluate third-party components
- **PW.4.2**: Maintain component inventory
- **PW.4.3**: Monitor component vulnerabilities

**Organizations MUST:**

- Verify component security
- Track component versions
- Update vulnerable components promptly
- Validate component integrity

#### PW.5: Create Source Code Using Secure Coding Practices

**Requirements:**

- **PW.5.1**: Follow secure coding standards
- **PW.5.2**: Use memory-safe languages when feasible
- **PW.5.3**: Validate all input

**Secure coding MUST address:**

- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Language-specific security issues
- Common weakness enumerations (CWEs)

#### PW.6: Configure Software to Have Secure Settings by Default

**Requirements:**

- **PW.6.1**: Disable unnecessary features
- **PW.6.2**: Use secure default values
- **PW.6.3**: Document security configurations

#### PW.7: Verify Third-Party Software Complies with Security Requirements

**Requirements:**

- **PW.7.1**: Assess third-party security
- **PW.7.2**: Require security attestations
- **PW.7.3**: Test integrated components

#### PW.8: Test Executable Code to Identify Vulnerabilities

**Requirements:**

- **PW.8.1**: Perform automated testing
- **PW.8.2**: Conduct manual code reviews
- **PW.8.3**: Execute penetration testing

**Testing MUST include:**

- Unit testing with security cases
- Integration security testing
- Fuzz testing for input validation
- Vulnerability scanning

### RV: Respond to Vulnerabilities

Organizations MUST identify, analyze, and remediate vulnerabilities appropriately.

#### RV.1: Identify and Confirm Vulnerabilities

**Requirements:**

- **RV.1.1**: Monitor for vulnerabilities continuously
- **RV.1.2**: Accept vulnerability reports
- **RV.1.3**: Verify reported vulnerabilities

**Organizations MUST:**

- Establish vulnerability disclosure process
- Monitor security advisories
- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments
- Maintain vulnerability tracking system

#### RV.2: Assess, Prioritize, and Remediate Vulnerabilities

**Requirements:**

- **RV.2.1**: Analyze vulnerability impact
- **RV.2.2**: Prioritize based on risk
- **RV.2.3**: Remediate within defined timeframes

**Remediation timeframes SHOULD be:**

- Critical: 15 days
- High: 30 days
- Medium: 90 days
