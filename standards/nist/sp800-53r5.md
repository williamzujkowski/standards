## Implementation Requirements

Organizations MUST:

- Select appropriate control baseline (Low, Moderate, High) based on system categorization
- Tailor controls based on risk assessment and organizational requirements
- Document control implementation in System Security Plan (SSP)
- Continuously monitor control effectiveness
- Maintain Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) for control deficiencies

Organizations SHOULD:

- Implement controls using automation where feasible
- Integrate privacy controls throughout the system lifecycle
- Consider supply chain risks in control selection
- Align with organizational risk management strategy

## Control Selection Process

1. **Categorize** the system using FIPS 199
2. **Select** initial control baseline from SP 800-53B
3. **Tailor** controls based on risk assessment
4. **Supplement** with additional controls as needed
5. **Document** decisions in System Security Plan

## Compliance Verification

Controls are verified through:

- Control assessments (CA-2)
- Continuous monitoring (CA-7)
- Independent audits
- Automated compliance scanning
- Security control testing
