# NIST AI RMF 1.0 - Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework

## Overview

The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) provides voluntary guidance for managing risks associated with artificial intelligence systems. Published as NIST.AI.100-1, it addresses risks to individuals, organizations, and society throughout the AI lifecycle.

## Core Functions

### GOVERN

Cultivate and communicate a culture of risk management throughout the AI lifecycle.

**Key Activities:**

- Establish AI risk management policies
- Define roles and responsibilities
- Ensure accountability structures
- Integrate into enterprise risk management

### MAP

Contextualize AI risks based on the system's context and capabilities.

**Key Activities:**

- Categorize the AI system
- Identify stakeholders
- Determine AI system capabilities
- Assess risk and impact

### MEASURE

Analyze, assess, and track AI risks using appropriate methods and metrics.

**Key Activities:**

- Test AI system performance
- Monitor for emerging risks
- Quantify uncertainty
- Validate measurements

### MANAGE

Allocate resources to treat risks appropriately based on assessments.

**Key Activities:**

- Prioritize risk response
- Implement controls
- Document decisions
- Monitor effectiveness

## AI Risk Categories

- **Harm to People**: Physical, psychological, or social
- **Harm to Organizations**: Operational, financial, reputational
- **Harm to Ecosystems**: Environmental impacts
- **Violation of Law**: Non-compliance with regulations

## Trustworthy AI Characteristics

Organizations SHOULD design AI systems to be:

- **Valid and Reliable**
- **Safe and Secure**
- **Accountable and Transparent**
- **Explainable and Interpretable**
- **Privacy-Enhanced**
- **Fair with Harmful Bias Managed**

## Implementation Requirements

Organizations MUST:

- Identify AI systems in use
- Assess risks throughout lifecycle
- Document risk management decisions
- Monitor AI system behavior

Organizations SHOULD:

- Adopt the AI RMF incrementally
- Tailor to organizational context
- Engage diverse stakeholders
- Maintain continuous improvement
