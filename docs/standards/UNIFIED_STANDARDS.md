#### Python Example
```python
"""Module documentation explaining purpose."""

from typing import List, Optional
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class UserService:
    """Service for managing user operations.

    This service handles user creation, authentication,
    and profile management.
    """

    def __init__(self, db_connection, cache_client):
        """Initialize UserService.

        Args:
            db_connection: Database connection instance
            cache_client: Cache client for performance
        """
        self._db = db_connection

## Usage Guidelines for Extended Standards

### Implementation Priority

1. **Start with Core Standards**: Implement the main unified standards first as the foundation
2. **Domain-Specific Extension**: Add specialized standards based on your technology stack and project requirements
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Implement extended standards incrementally, focusing on areas with the highest impact
4. **Cross-Reference Integration**: Ensure compatibility between core and extended standards

### Integration Tools and Resources

The repository includes comprehensive integration tools to facilitate standards adoption:

- **Automated Setup**: Use `setup-project.sh` for quick project initialization with standards
- **Integration Guide**: Follow `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed integration strategies
- **Adoption Checklist**: Use `ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md` for systematic week-by-week implementation
- **Templates**: Language-specific configurations in `examples/project-templates/` directory
- **CI/CD Integration**: Pre-configured workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- **Badge Generation**: Use `generate-badges.sh` to create compliance badges

### Customization Approach

Each extended standard can be customized for your organization by:
- Selecting relevant sections based on your technology choices
- Adapting examples to your specific tools and platforms
- Adding organization-specific policies and procedures
- Creating implementation checklists for your teams

### Maintenance and Updates

- Review extended standards quarterly alongside core standards
- Update specialized standards when new technologies or practices emerge
- Maintain consistency between core and extended standards
- Document any deviations or additions specific to your organization
