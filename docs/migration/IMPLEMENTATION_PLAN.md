# Skills Migration Implementation Plan

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Ready for Execution
**Owner**: Planning Agent (swarm-1760669629248-p81glgo36)

---

## Executive Summary

This plan provides a comprehensive 5-phase roadmap for transforming the williamzujkowski/standards repository from its current documentation-centric architecture to Anthropic's Agent Skills format. The migration will unlock autonomous skill discovery, progressive disclosure token optimization (95%+ reduction), and enhanced automation capabilities.

### Key Outcomes

- **48 focused skills** created from 25 existing standards
- **95%+ token reduction** from current optimized baseline
- **Zero breaking changes** via backward compatibility layer
- **Automated migration** for consistency and speed
- **8-week timeline** with clear quality gates

### Critical Finding

The review phase revealed that while planning is excellent (9/10 quality), **no SKILL.md files exist yet** (0% implementation). This plan prioritizes automation-first approach to ensure consistency, speed, and maintainability.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Automation (Week 1)

**Objective**: Establish infrastructure, automation, and prove the pattern with one complete skill.

---

# Python Development Standards

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive Python development guidance following modern best practices, PEP standards, and industry conventions. It covers code style, type safety, async programming, project structure, dependency management, and tooling integration.

## When to Use This Skill

- Building Python applications (web services, APIs, CLIs, data pipelines)
- Implementing async/concurrent systems with asyncio
- Setting up Python project structure and dependency management
- Configuring linters, formatters, and type checkers
- Writing Pythonic, maintainable, production-ready code
- Migrating legacy Python to modern standards

## Core Instructions

### Code Style & PEP Compliance

Follow PEP 8 for style, PEP 257 for docstrings, and PEP 484 for type hints:

- **Line Length**: 88 characters (Black default) or 120 (team preference)
- **Naming**: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes
- **Imports**: Organized (stdlib → third-party → local), use isort
- **Docstrings**: Google style preferred, include type information

### Type Hints

Use comprehensive type hints for function signatures, class attributes, and complex structures:

```python
from typing import Optional, List, Dict
from datetime import datetime

def process_data(
    items: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    threshold: Optional[float] = None,
    created_after: Optional[datetime] = None
) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """Process items and return summary statistics."""
    # Implementation
```

### Async Patterns

Use asyncio for I/O-bound operations, aiohttp for HTTP, asyncpg for PostgreSQL:

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data(session: aiohttp.ClientSession, url: str) -> dict:
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.json()
```

### Project Structure

Standard layout for Python projects:

```
project/
├── src/
│   └── package/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── core.py
│       └── utils.py
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_core.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

### Dependency Management

Use `pyproject.toml` for all metadata and dependencies. See `./templates/pyproject.toml.template`.

### Testing

Use pytest for testing, pytest-cov for coverage. Configure in `pytest.ini`. See `./templates/pytest.ini.template`.

## Advanced Topics

- **For detailed style guide**: See `./resources/python-style-guide.md`
- **For advanced type hints**: See `./resources/advanced-typing.md`
- **For async patterns**: See `./resources/async-programming.md`
- **For project templates**: Explore `./templates/`
- **To run linting**: Execute `./scripts/lint.sh`
- **To auto-format code**: Execute `./scripts/format.sh`

## Examples

### Example 1: FastAPI REST API

See `./examples/fastapi-api/` for a complete FastAPI application demonstrating:
- Type-safe endpoints with Pydantic
- Async database access with SQLAlchemy 2.0
- Structured logging and error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Example 2: CLI Tool with Typer

See `./examples/cli-tool/` for a CLI application showing:
- Command-line parsing with Typer
- Configuration management
- Testing CLI applications

### Example 3: Data Pipeline

See `./examples/data-pipeline/` for async data processing:
- Async HTTP requests with aiohttp
- Concurrent processing with asyncio.gather
- Error handling and retries
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ SKILL.md passes all validation checks
- ✅ Token count <5000 for main file
- ✅ All resources properly bundled
- ✅ Scripts executable and tested
- ✅ Loads successfully in Claude API
- ✅ Template documented for team

### 1.4 Meta-Skills Creation

**Duration**: 8 hours
**Owner**: Integration engineer
**Priority**: Critical

**Skill 1: skill-loader** (`skills/skill-loader/SKILL.md`)

**Purpose**: Intelligent skill discovery and loading based on @load patterns and natural language.

**Functionality**:
- Parse @load directives (product:api, security:*, explicit-skill-name)
- Resolve product-matrix.yaml to skill sets
- Expand wildcards (testing:* → all testing skills)
- Compose multiple skills for complex workflows
- Provide skill search and filtering

**Implementation**:
```yaml
---
name: skill-loader
description: Intelligent skill discovery and loading system that identifies which skills are needed based on natural language requests, product types, or explicit @load patterns. Automatically composes multiple skills for complex workflows and integrates with product-matrix.yaml for standardized loading. Use at the start of any development task to ensure relevant skills are available.
---
# [Full content following template]
```

**Skill 2: legacy-bridge** (`skills/legacy-bridge/SKILL.md`)

**Purpose**: Backward compatibility layer mapping old @load patterns to new skills.

**Functionality**:
- Map old standard names to new skill names
- Support legacy @load syntax (e.g., @load CODING_STANDARDS.md#python)
- Provide deprecation warnings with migration paths
- Reference archived standards in docs/standards/
- Gradual transition support (both systems work in parallel)

**Implementation**:
```yaml
---
name: legacy-bridge
description: Backward compatibility layer that maps old @load patterns and standard references to new Agent Skills. Provides deprecation warnings, migration guidance, and maintains access to archived standards. Use automatically when legacy patterns are detected to ensure smooth transition for existing users.
---
# [Full content following template]
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ skill-loader functional and tested

### 4.2 CLAUDE.md Router Update (Week 6)

**Duration**: 4 hours
**Owner**: Documentation engineer
**Priority**: Critical

**Updates to `CLAUDE.md`**:

```markdown
# Claude Code Configuration - Skills Router

## 🚀 Fast Path: Skills Auto-Loading

### Quick Load by Product Type

```
@load product:api              # Loads skill set for API services
@load product:web-service      # Loads skill set for web apps
@load product:frontend-web     # Loads skill set for SPAs
@load product:mobile           # Loads skill set for mobile apps
@load product:data-pipeline    # Loads skill set for data workflows
@load product:ml-service       # Loads skill set for ML systems
```

### Custom Skill Combinations

```
@load python + security-auth + unit-testing    # Explicit skills
@load security:*                                # All security skills
@load testing:* + logging                       # Category + specific skill
```

### How It Works

1. **skill-loader** meta-skill activates automatically
2. Parses @load directive (product type, category, or explicit skills)
3. Resolves product-matrix.yaml for skill sets
4. Expands wildcards (security:* → all security skills)
5. Loads relevant SKILL.md files with progressive disclosure
6. Composes multiple skills for complex workflows

### Backward Compatibility

Legacy @load patterns automatically routed via **legacy-bridge** skill:

```
@load CODING_STANDARDS.md#python  →  Redirects to python skill
@load MODERN_SECURITY_STANDARDS.md  →  Redirects to security:* skills
```

**Deprecation Notice**: Legacy patterns will be removed in 6 months. Migrate to new @load syntax.

## Skills Architecture

All standards have been transformed into **Agent Skills** with progressive disclosure:

- **Level 1 (Metadata)**: Name + description (~100 tokens, always loaded)
- **Level 2 (Instructions)**: Core guidance (<5k tokens, loaded when relevant)
- **Level 3 (Resources)**: Detailed docs, templates, scripts (filesystem-based, on-demand)

### Token Optimization

- **Old System**: 10,000 tokens (CLAUDE.md @load system, 90% reduction from baseline)
- **New System**: 2,500 tokens (all skill metadata, 99% reduction from baseline)
- **Typical Workflow**: 5,000 tokens (2-3 skills loaded)

### Skill Categories

- **coding**: python, javascript, typescript, go, rust
- **security**: auth, secrets, zero-trust, threat-modeling, input-validation
- **testing**: unit-testing, integration-testing, e2e-testing, performance-testing
- **devops**: ci-cd, infrastructure, monitoring
- **cloud-native**: kubernetes, containers, serverless
- **frontend**: react, vue, mobile-ios, mobile-android
- **data-engineering**: orchestration, data-quality
- **ml-ai**: model-development, model-deployment
- **observability**: logging, tracing
- **And more...** (see config/skills-catalog.yaml)

### Migration Guide

For detailed migration instructions, see: `docs/guides/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ CLAUDE.md updated with Skills syntax
- ✅ Backward compatibility documented
- ✅ Deprecation timeline clear
