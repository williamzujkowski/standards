## Critical Risks (Severity: Critical)

### RISK-001: Breaking Changes for Existing Users

**Category**: User Impact
**Severity**: Critical
**Likelihood**: High
**Risk Level**: 🔴 **Extreme**

**Description**: Migration introduces breaking changes that disrupt existing user workflows, causing adoption resistance or project abandonment.

**Impact**:
- User frustration and complaints
- Negative community perception
- Fork pressure or migration to alternatives
- Support burden increases
- Project reputation damage

**Root Causes**:
- Incomplete backward compatibility
- Missing legacy pattern support
- Insufficient testing of migration paths
- Poor communication of changes

**Mitigation Strategy**:

1. **Legacy-Bridge Skill** (Phase 1):
   - Create robust legacy-bridge meta-skill
   - Map ALL old @load patterns to new skills
   - Implement automatic redirection with warnings
   - Test 100% of documented legacy patterns

2. **Parallel Systems** (Phase 4-7):
   - Maintain both old and new systems operational
   - No forced migration during transition period
   - Gradual rollout with user choice
   - Clear opt-in mechanism

3. **Comprehensive Testing** (Phase 2-6):
   - Backward compatibility test suite
   - User acceptance testing (UAT)
   - Beta testing with select users
   - Integration testing across all use cases

4. **Clear Communication** (Phase 7):
   - Detailed migration guide
   - Side-by-side comparison docs
   - Video tutorials for migration
   - FAQ addressing all concerns
   - Deprecation timeline (6+ months)

**Contingency Plan**:

If breaking changes discovered post-launch:
1. **Immediate** (Hour 0-1):
   - Execute emergency rollback (scripts/rollback-to-legacy.sh)
   - Post incident notification
   - Disable skills system temporarily
2. **Short-term** (Hour 1-24):
   - Identify root cause
   - Develop hot-fix
   - Test hot-fix thoroughly
3. **Recovery** (Day 2-7):
   - Deploy hot-fix incrementally
   - Re-enable skills with monitoring
   - Communicate resolution
   - Post-mortem analysis

**Monitoring**:
- Daily review of GitHub issues during first 2 weeks
- User feedback survey (target: >4.5/5 satisfaction)
- Support ticket volume and sentiment
- Migration tool usage and success rate

**Responsibility**: Project Lead + QA Lead
**Status**: Mitigation active from Phase 1

### RISK-002: Token Limits Exceeded in SKILL.md

**Category**: Technical
**Severity**: Critical
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Risk Level**: 🟠 **High**

**Description**: SKILL.md bodies exceed 5,000 token limit, degrading performance and defeating progressive disclosure benefits.

**Impact**:
- Slow skill load times (>500ms)
- Token efficiency targets missed (<95% reduction)
- Poor user experience
- System performance degradation
- Claude API rate limiting

**Root Causes**:
- Insufficient content externalization

   - Implement token counter in validation script
   - Hard limit: 5,000 tokens per SKILL.md
   - Warning threshold: 4,500 tokens
   - Fail validation if exceeded

2. **Aggressive Externalization** (Phase 2-4):
   - Move all detailed content to resources/
   - Extract code blocks >50 lines to examples/
   - Reference templates instead of embedding
   - Use scripts for automation (zero token cost)

3. **Content Review Process** (Phase 2-5):
   - Peer review all skills for verbosity
   - "Less is more" principle enforced
   - Focus on conceptual guidance, not detail
   - Link to resources for depth

4. **Progressive Disclosure Validation** (Phase 3):
   - Verify Level 1 (metadata) <100 tokens
   - Verify Level 2 (instructions) <5k tokens
   - Verify Level 3 (resources) properly referenced
   - Test that resources load on-demand only

**Contingency Plan**:

If skill exceeds token limit:
1. **Analyze** (30 minutes):
   - Run token count breakdown by section
   - Identify heaviest sections
2. **Refactor** (1-2 hours):
   - Extract heavy sections to resources/
   - Reduce verbosity
   - Simplify examples
   - Re-validate
3. **Split Skill** (if still over limit):
   - Divide into 2+ focused sub-skills
   - Create parent skill with navigation
   - Update catalog and mappings

**Monitoring**:
- Token count for every skill tracked in catalog
- Average token count per category
- Outliers flagged for review
- Re-validation every sprint
