# OSCAL Integration for Standards Repository

## What is OSCAL?

The Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) is a NIST-developed standard for representing security controls, assessments, and compliance information in machine-readable formats (JSON, XML, YAML).

## Why OSCAL for This Repository?

- **Machine-Readable Standards**: Transform our markdown standards into structured OSCAL catalogs
- **Reusable Components**: Create component definitions for common implementation patterns
- **Automated Compliance**: Enable automated control selection and assessment
- **Interoperability**: Exchange compliance data with OSCAL-compatible tools

## Planned OSCAL Structure

### Component Definitions

- Reusable implementation statements for each standard
- Technology-specific control implementations
- Mapped to our existing standards pages

### Profiles

- Baseline selections (Low, Moderate, High)
- Tailored control sets for specific use cases
- Organization-specific customizations

## Next Steps

1. **Create OSCAL catalog** for our NIST SP 800-53 content
2. **Generate component definitions** for common patterns
3. **Build profile examples** for typical implementations
4. **Develop conversion scripts** from markdown to OSCAL
5. **Validate OSCAL content** using NIST tools
6. **Document mapping** between our standards and OSCAL models

## Near-term OSCAL Work

### Pilot Artifacts (Priority)

1. **Component Definition** for "Standards Repository"
   - Define this repository as a reusable component
   - Map our standards to OSCAL control implementations
   - Include implementation status for each control

2. **Profile Stub** referencing SP 800-53B baselines
   - Import Low/Moderate/High baselines
   - Demonstrate control selection and tailoring
   - Add organization-specific parameters

### Actionable Next Steps

- [ ] Install OSCAL CLI tools for validation ([OSCAL CLI](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/tools/))
- [ ] Create `oscal/component-definitions/standards-repo.json` using [component schema](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/reference/latest/component-definition/json-schema/)
- [ ] Generate profile from [SP 800-53B baseline](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-content/tree/main/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev5)
- [ ] Validate artifacts using `oscal-cli validate`
- [ ] Document mapping between our markdown standards and OSCAL controls
- [ ] Create conversion script: `scripts/markdown-to-oscal.js`
