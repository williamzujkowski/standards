# Zero-Trust Security

## Level 1: Quick Reference

### Core Principles

Zero-trust architecture operates on the principle: **"Never trust, always verify."** Unlike traditional perimeter-based security, zero-trust assumes breach and verifies every request regardless of origin.

**Fundamental Tenets:**

- No implicit trust based on network location
- Verify explicitly (authentication + authorization)
- Least privilege access (just-in-time, just-enough)
- Assume breach (limit blast radius, segment access)
- Inspect and log all traffic

### Common Zero-Trust Patterns

#### 1. Mutual TLS (mTLS)

```yaml
# Istio PeerAuthentication for strict mTLS
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: production
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

**When to use:** Service-to-service authentication, encrypted communication between microservices.

#### 2. Service Mesh

- **Istio/Linkerd:** Transparent mTLS, traffic encryption, identity management
- **Consul Connect:** Service identity and authorization
- **AWS App Mesh:** Cloud-native service mesh

**Key benefits:** Automatic encryption, fine-grained policies, observability.

#### 3. BeyondCorp Model

```yaml
# Identity-aware proxy configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: webapp
  annotations:
    cloud.google.com/neg: '{"ingress": true}'
    cloud.google.com/backend-config: '{"default": "beyondcorp-config"}'
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
```

**Use case:** Remote access without VPN, identity-based access to applications.

### Essential Checklist

**Identity & Authentication:**

- [ ] Workload identities for all services (SPIFFE/SPIRE)
- [ ] mTLS enabled for service-to-service communication
- [ ] Strong authentication (MFA, certificates, tokens)
- [ ] Identity lifecycle management (rotation, revocation)

**Authorization:**

- [ ] Fine-grained access policies (attribute-based)
- [ ] Least privilege by default
- [ ] Just-in-time access provisioning
- [ ] Policy enforcement at every access point

**Network Security:**

- [ ] Microsegmentation (NetworkPolicies, security groups)
- [ ] Encrypted communication (TLS 1.3+)
- [ ] Traffic inspection and filtering
- [ ] No trust based on network location

**Monitoring & Verification:**

- [ ] Continuous monitoring of authentication events
- [ ] Anomaly detection on access patterns
- [ ] Centralized logging (who, what, when, where)
- [ ] Regular access reviews and audits

**Architecture:**

- [ ] Policy Decision Point (PDP) implemented
- [ ] Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) at critical paths
- [ ] Policy Administration Point (PAP) for management
- [ ] Data plane and control plane separation

### Quick Wins

1. **Enable mTLS in service mesh** (2-4 hours)
   - Deploy Istio/Linkerd
   - Configure strict mTLS mode
   - Verify with traffic inspection

2. **Implement Kubernetes NetworkPolicies** (1-2 hours)
   - Default deny all traffic
   - Explicit allow rules per service
   - Test connectivity

3. **Deploy workload identities** (3-4 hours)
   - Install SPIFFE/SPIRE
   - Configure workload attestation
   - Integrate with service mesh

 Implementation Guide

### Zero-Trust Architecture Principles

Zero-trust architecture (ZTA) fundamentally reimagines security by eliminating implicit trust. Traditional castle-and-moat security assumes everything inside the perimeter is trustworthy, but ZTA treats every request as potentially hostile.

#### NIST 800-207 Zero Trust Tenets

1. **All data sources and computing services are considered resources**
   - Applications, services, databases, IoT devices, containers
   - Resources may be on-premises, cloud, edge, or hybrid

2. **All communication is secured regardless of network location**
   - Encrypt all traffic (mTLS, TLS 1.3)
   - No trust based on internal network position
   - Apply same security to internal and external traffic

3. **Access to resources is granted on a per-session basis**
   - Authentication and authorization for every request
   - Continuous verification throughout session
   - Short-lived credentials and tokens

4. **Access is determined by dynamic policy**
   - User identity, device health, behavior, risk score
   - Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
   - Context-aware decisions (time, location, sensitivity)

5. **Monitor and measure integrity and security posture**
   - Continuous monitoring of assets
   - Real-time threat detection
   - Security analytics and automation

6. **All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced**
   - No static rules or permanent access
   - Adaptive policies based on risk
   - Fail-secure by default

7. **Collect as much information as possible about current state**
   - Asset inventory and behavior
   - Network traffic analysis
   - Security telemetry and logs

**NIST Controls:**

- **AC-4:** Information Flow Enforcement - Control information flow between security domains
- **SC-7:** Boundary Protection - Monitor and control communications at managed interfaces
- **SC-8:** Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity - Protect information during transmission

### NIST 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture

NIST SP 800-207 provides a comprehensive framework for implementing zero-trust architecture in federal and enterprise systems.

#### Zero Trust Architecture Components

**1. Policy Engine (PE):**

- Grants or denies access to resources
- Uses Policy Administrator to execute decisions
- Considers user, device, resource, and contextual attributes

**2. Policy Administrator (PA):**

- Establishes/shuts down communication paths
- Generates session-specific authentication tokens
- Instructs Policy Enforcement Points

**3. Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):**

- Enables, monitors, and terminates connections
- Forwards requests to Policy Engine
- Can be gateway, agent, or access proxy

**Implementation Example:**



*See [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md#example-18) for complete implementation.*



#### Trust Algorithm (TA)

The Trust Algorithm computes trust scores based on multiple inputs:



*See [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md#example-19) for complete implementation.*

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Insufficient Testing

**Problem:** Not testing edge cases and error conditions leads to production bugs

**Solution:** Implement comprehensive test coverage including:

- Happy path scenarios
- Error handling and edge cases
- Integration points with external systems

**Prevention:** Enforce minimum code coverage (80%+) in CI/CD pipeline

### Pitfall 2: Hardcoded Configuration

**Problem:** Hardcoding values makes applications inflexible and environment-dependent

**Solution:** Use environment variables and configuration management:

- Separate config from code
- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Never commit secrets to version control

**Prevention:** Use tools like dotenv, config validators, and secret scanners

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Security Best Practices

**Problem:** Security vulnerabilities from not following established security patterns

**Solution:** Follow security guidelines:

- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Encrypted data transmission (TLS/SSL)
- Regular security audits and updates

**Prevention:** Use security linters, SAST tools, and regular dependency updates

**Best Practices:**

- Follow established patterns and conventions for zero-trust
- Keep dependencies up to date and scan for vulnerabilities
- Write comprehensive documentation and inline comments
- Use linting and formatting tools consistently
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Regular code reviews and pair programming
- Monitor production metrics and set up alerts
