# Threat Modeling

> **Identify, prioritize, and mitigate security threats systematically using STRIDE methodology**

## Level 1: Quick Reference

### STRIDE Threat Categories

```yaml
threats:
  S_spoofing:
    description: Impersonating something or someone else
    targets: [authentication, identity]
    example: "Using stolen credentials to access system"

  T_tampering:
    description: Modifying data or code maliciously
    targets: [data_integrity, code_integrity]
    example: "Altering transaction amounts in transit"

  R_repudiation:
    description: Claiming to not have performed an action
    targets: [logging, audit_trails]
    example: "Denying fraudulent transaction was performed"

  I_information_disclosure:
    description: Exposing information to unauthorized parties
    targets: [confidentiality, data_protection]
    example: "Leaking customer PII through error messages"

  D_denial_of_service:
    description: Making system unavailable or degraded
    targets: [availability, performance]
    example: "Overwhelming API with requests"

  E_elevation_of_privilege:
    description: Gaining unauthorized higher access level
    targets: [authorization, access_control]
    example: "Exploiting bug to gain admin rights"
```

### Four Key Questions

1. **What are we building?**
   - System architecture, components, data flows
   - Trust boundaries, entry/exit points

2. **What can go wrong?**
   - Apply STRIDE to each component
   - Identify threat scenarios

3. **What should we do about it?**
   - Prioritize threats (DREAD scoring)
   - Design mitigations

4. **Did we do a good job?**
   - Review threat model coverage
   - Validate mitigations

### Essential Checklist

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Insufficient Testing

**Problem:** Not testing edge cases and error conditions leads to production bugs

**Solution:** Implement comprehensive test coverage including:

- Happy path scenarios
- Error handling and edge cases
- Integration points with external systems

**Prevention:** Enforce minimum code coverage (80%+) in CI/CD pipeline

### Pitfall 2: Hardcoded Configuration

**Problem:** Hardcoding values makes applications inflexible and environment-dependent

**Solution:** Use environment variables and configuration management:

- Separate config from code
- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Never commit secrets to version control

**Prevention:** Use tools like dotenv, config validators, and secret scanners

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Security Best Practices

**Problem:** Security vulnerabilities from not following established security patterns

**Solution:** Follow security guidelines:

- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Encrypted data transmission (TLS/SSL)
- Regular security audits and updates

**Prevention:** Use security linters, SAST tools, and regular dependency updates

**Best Practices:**

- Follow established patterns and conventions for threat-modeling
- Keep dependencies up to date and scan for vulnerabilities
- Write comprehensive documentation and inline comments
- Use linting and formatting tools consistently
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Regular code reviews and pair programming
- Monitor production metrics and set up alerts
