*Each requirement contains multiple sub-requirements - see REFERENCE.md for complete compliance checklist.*

### Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) Segmentation

**Network Segmentation Strategy**



*See [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md#example-0) for complete implementation.*



**Key Segmentation Controls:**

1. Firewall rules whitelist only required protocols (HTTPS, database ports)
2. Network ACLs deny by default, permit by exception
3. VLANs separate CDE from other networks
4. Jump boxes/bastion hosts for administrative access
5. No direct internet access from CDE
6. Annual penetration testing validates segmentation

### Payment Processing Security

**Tokenization Implementation**



*See [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md#example-1) for complete implementation.*



**Encryption Requirements**

| Data State | Requirement | Algorithm | Key Length |
|------------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| At Rest    | PAN encrypted | AES | 256-bit minimum |
| In Transit | TLS 1.2+    | ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 | 2048-bit RSA minimum |
| Backups    | Encrypted   | AES-256 | 256-bit |
| Key Storage| Encrypted KEK | AES-256 | 256-bit |

**Key Management Lifecycle**

1. **Generation**: FIPS 140-2 Level 2+ HSM
2. **Distribution**: Encrypted channels, split knowledge
