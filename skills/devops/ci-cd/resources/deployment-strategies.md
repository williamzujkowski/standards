# Deployment Strategies Guide

## Overview

This guide covers deployment strategies for minimizing risk and downtime during software releases.

## Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Downtime | Risk | Complexity | Rollback Speed | Best For |
|----------|----------|------|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Rolling Update** | None | Low | Low | Fast | Most applications |
| **Blue-Green** | None | Low | Medium | Instant | Zero-downtime deployments |
| **Canary** | None | Very Low | High | Fast | High-traffic apps |
| **Recreate** | Yes | High | Low | Fast | Development/testing |

## Rolling Update

Gradually replaces old instances with new ones.

**Pros:**

- No downtime
- Resource efficient
- Simple to implement

**Cons:**

- Both versions run simultaneously
- Gradual rollout may delay issue detection

**When to use:** Standard deployments with backward-compatible changes

## Blue-Green Deployment

Maintains two identical environments (blue=production, green=staging).

**Pros:**

- Instant rollback
- Full testing before switch
- Zero downtime

**Cons:**

- Double resource requirements
- Database migrations complexity
- Higher cost

**When to use:** Critical applications requiring instant rollback capability

## Canary Deployment

Routes small percentage of traffic to new version.

**Pros:**

- Minimal user impact
- Real-world testing
- Gradual confidence building

**Cons:**

- Complex traffic management
- Requires monitoring
- Longer deployment time

**When to use:** High-risk changes in high-traffic applications

## Recreate

Stops old version, then starts new version.

**Pros:**

- Simple
- No version conflicts
- Clean state

**Cons:**

- Downtime
- User disruption

**When to use:** Development environments, non-critical applications
