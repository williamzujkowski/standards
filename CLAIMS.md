# Normative Claims Registry

This document extracts and catalogs all normative statements (MUST, SHOULD, SHALL, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, MAY) found within this standards repository, along with their authoritative sources.

## Legend

- **MUST/SHALL/REQUIRED**: Absolute requirement (mandatory for compliance)
- **MUST NOT/SHALL NOT**: Absolute prohibition
- **SHOULD/RECOMMENDED**: Strong recommendation (deviation requires justification)
- **SHOULD NOT**: Strong discouragement
- **MAY/OPTIONAL**: Truly optional
