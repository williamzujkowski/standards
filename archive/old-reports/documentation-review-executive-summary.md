### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Correction (7 Issues)

#### üî¥ Critical (Fix Immediately)

1. **Agent Count Claim** (CLAUDE.md:88)
   - Claims: "49 Available Agents"
   - Reality: 49 conceptual agent **types**, not actual tools
   - Actual MCP tools: 87
   - **Fix**: Clarify terminology - "Agent Types" vs "MCP Tools"

2. **Non-Existent npm Commands** (CLAUDE.md:73-78)
   - Documents: `npm run build`, `npm run test`, etc.
   - Reality: No package.json at repository root
   - **Fix**: Replace with actual Python/mkdocs commands

#### üü° High Priority (Fix This Week)

3. **Unverified Performance Claims** (docs/README.md:96-101)
   - Claims: "50% reduction", "40% faster", "90% compliance", "3x improvement"
   - Issue: No source data, methodology, or sample size
   - **Fix**: Replace with "Expected Benefits" with proper disclaimers

4. **Token Reduction Without Baseline** (README.md:18)
   - Claims: "99%+ token reduction"
   - Issue: No baseline comparison provided
   - **Fix**: Add context: "from ~150K to ~2K tokens"

5. **Skills Count Mismatch** (docs/SKILLS_CATALOG.md:5)
   - Claims: "Total Skills: 5"
   - Reality: 62 SKILL.md files exist
   - **Fix**: Clarify "5 core documented, 62+ total available"

6. **"Battle-Tested" Claim** (README.md:3)
   - Claims: "Battle-tested standards from real production systems"
   - Issue: Cannot be independently verified
   - **Fix**: Replace with "based on industry best practices"

#### üîµ Medium Priority (Address When Possible)

7. **Vague Optimization Claims** (CLAUDE.md:250)
   - Claims: "Significant token optimization"
   - Issue: "Significant" is unmeasurable
   - **Fix**: Quantify: "98% reduction from 150K to 2K tokens"

## Evidence & Verification

### Verified Accurate Claims

```bash
# Skills exist
$ find skills -name "SKILL.md" | wc -l
62

# MCP tools available
$ npx claude-flow@alpha mcp tools 2>&1 | grep -c "^  ‚Ä¢"
87

# Audit scripts work
$ python3 scripts/generate-audit-reports.py
‚úì Success (generates reports/generated/structure-audit.json)

# CI workflows exist
$ ls -1 .github/workflows/*.yml | wc -l
11

# NIST quickstart functional
$ cd examples/nist-templates/quickstart && make help
‚úì Shows available targets
```

### Issues Confirmed

```bash
# No package.json at root
$ test -f package.json
‚úó File not found

# Performance claims unverified
$ grep -n "50% reduction" docs/README.md
98:- **50% reduction** in production incidents
# No source data in file

# Agent count discrepancy
$ grep "Available Agents (49 Total)" CLAUDE.md
88:## üöÄ Available Agents (49 Total)
# But these are conceptual types, not actual tools
```

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Today - 1 hour)

1. **Update CLAUDE.md Line 88**

   ```markdown
   ## üöÄ Agent Types & Roles (49 Conceptual Patterns)

   These are example agent role patterns that can be implemented using
   Claude-Flow's 87 MCP tools. See MCP Tool Categories below for actual tools.
   ```

2. **Replace CLAUDE.md Lines 73-78**

   ```markdown
   ## Repository Commands

   **Validation & Auditing**:
   - `python3 scripts/generate-audit-reports.py` - Run audits
   - `python3 scripts/validate-skills.py` - Validate skills
   - `mkdocs serve` - Serve documentation locally
   ```

### High Priority (This Week - 1 hour)

3. **Update Performance Claims** - Replace with "Expected Benefits" + disclaimers
4. **Add Token Baseline** - Show "from 150K to 2K" comparison
5. **Fix Skills Count** - Clarify "5 core, 62+ total"
6. **Remove "Battle-Tested"** - Replace with "industry best practices"

### Optional Enhancement (This Month)

7. **Quantify Claims** - Add benchmarking methodology document
8. **Add Case Studies** - Create discussions for user experiences
9. **Verify Hooks** - Test all hook commands with examples
