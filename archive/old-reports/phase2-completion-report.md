### Recommended Path Forward

**Option A: 2-Day Sprint (RECOMMENDED)**

**Approach:** Focused implementation of P0/P1 skills

**Day 1 (6-7 hours):**

- Authentication (3-4h) - Coder Agent 1
- Secrets Management (2-3h) - Coder Agent 1
- CI/CD (3-4h) - Coder Agent 2

**Day 2 (4-5 hours):**

- Unit Testing (2-3h) - Coder Agent 1
- Integration Testing (2-3h) - Coder Agent 2
- Validation of all 5 new skills

**Remaining (Optional - Day 3):**

- Kubernetes (3-4h) - Coder Agent 1
- React streamlined (1-2h) - Coder Agent 2
- Final validation

**Pros:**

- ✅ Addresses critical P0 gaps (security, deployment)
- ✅ Achieves 80% completion after Day 1-2 (8 of 10)
- ✅ Unblocks Phase 3 security/testing/devops tracks
- ✅ Proven templates exist (JavaScript, Go, TypeScript)
- ✅ Realistic timeline (10-12 hours over 2 days)

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ Requires dedicated coder resources
- ⚠️ May defer K8s and React to Phase 3 Week 1

**Recommendation:** **PROCEED WITH OPTION A**

---

**Option B: Scale Back Scope**

- CI/CD (P0)
- Unit Testing, Integration Testing (P1)

**Defer to Phase 3 Week 1 (2 skills):**

- Kubernetes (P2)
- React (P2, covered in JavaScript)

**Pros:**

- ✅ Achieves 80% completion (acceptable threshold)
- ✅ Addresses all P0/P1 skills
- ✅ Unblocks Phase 3 progression
- ✅ Lower implementation burden (10-12 hours vs 15-22)

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ Incomplete Phase 2 (80% vs 100% target)
- ⚠️ K8s and React pushed to Phase 3

**Recommendation:** **ACCEPTABLE FALLBACK**
