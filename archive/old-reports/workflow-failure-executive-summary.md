# Workflow Failure Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Branch:** audit-gates-final/20251017
**Status:** ❌ FAILED (Cosmetic formatting only - NOT a critical failure)

---

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

```bash
# Run pre-commit to auto-fix all formatting issues
pre-commit run --all-files

# Commit the auto-formatted files
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: apply pre-commit auto-formatting (JSON indentation, markdown style)"
git push
```

**Done!** Next CI run will pass.

---

## What's Wrong?

### 1. JSON Formatting (16 files)

- **Issue:** Inconsistent indentation (mix of 2-space, 4-space, compact)
- **Fix:** Pre-commit auto-formats to standard 2-space indentation
- **Status:** ✅ AUTO-FIXABLE

### 2. Markdown Linting (6 files)

- **Issue:** Style violations (bold syntax, horizontal rules, missing H1 headings)
- **Fix:** Pre-commit auto-fixes most issues
- **Status:** ✅ AUTO-FIXABLE (95%), ⚠️ 2 files need manual H1 addition

---

## Why Is This Failing?

Pre-commit hooks **auto-fix** formatting issues, which causes files to be modified during CI checks. In CI/CD pipelines, modified files = failure (even though the fixes are correct).

**Solution:** Run pre-commit locally and commit the auto-fixed files.

## Detailed Issues

| Issue Type | Affected Files | Rule | Fix Method |
|-----------|----------------|------|------------|
| JSON Indentation | 16 files | pretty-format-json | AUTO |
| Bold Syntax (`__` → `**`) | phase*-tracker.md (6 occurrences) | MD050 | AUTO |
| Horizontal Rules (`_____` → `---`) | 5 files (100+ lines) | MD035 | AUTO |
| Missing H1 Heading | skills_alignment.md | MD041 | MANUAL |
| Setext Heading → ATX | react/SKILL.md | MD003 | MANUAL |
| Duplicate Heading | SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md | MD024 | MANUAL |

---

## Affected Files

### JSON (All auto-fixable)

```
reports/generated/standards-inventory.json
reports/generated/structure-audit.json
reports/generated/script-coverage.json
skills/*/templates/*.json (13 files)
```

### Markdown (Mostly auto-fixable)

```
skills_alignment.md                    ← Needs H1 (manual)
skills/frontend/react/SKILL.md         ← Needs heading fix (manual)
docs/migration/phase*-*.md (4 files)   ← Auto-fixable
docs/guides/SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md   ← Duplicate heading (manual)
skills/security/zero-trust/resources/nist-800-207-checklist.md ← Auto-fixable
```

## Impact Assessment

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Code Functionality** | ✅ UNAFFECTED | All code runs correctly |
| **Documentation Content** | ✅ UNAFFECTED | No content changes needed |
| **Security Scans** | ✅ PASSING | Gitleaks, secrets detection all pass |
| **Link Validation** | ✅ PASSING | No broken links |
| **Structure Audit** | ✅ PASSING | All gates satisfied |
| **Other Workflows** | ✅ PASSING | 4/5 workflows successful |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | ❌ BLOCKED | Pre-commit formatting check fails |

**Severity:** LOW ⚠️ (Cosmetic only - no functional impact)

---

## Manual Fixes (Only if pre-commit doesn't catch them)

### 1. skills_alignment.md

```bash
# Add H1 heading at the start of the file
echo "# Skills Alignment" > /tmp/header.txt
echo "" >> /tmp/header.txt
cat skills_alignment.md >> /tmp/header.txt
mv /tmp/header.txt skills_alignment.md
```

### 2. skills/frontend/react/SKILL.md

```bash
# Change line 5 from setext (===) to ATX (#) style
# Option A: Delete the === line
sed -i '5d' skills/frontend/react/SKILL.md

# Option B: Use YAML front matter instead
# (Pre-commit should handle this)
```

### 3. docs/guides/SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md

```bash
# Find duplicate "## Bundled Resources" heading at line 561
# Change to "## Additional Bundled Resources"
sed -i '561s/## Bundled Resources/## Additional Bundled Resources/' docs/guides/SKILL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md
```

---

## Validation

After fixes, verify with:

```bash
# 1. Pre-commit should pass with no changes
pre-commit run --all-files
# Expected: ✅ All checks passed, no files modified

# 2. Git should show clean working tree
git status
# Expected: "working tree clean"

# 3. Audit gates should pass
python3 scripts/generate-audit-reports.py
cat reports/generated/structure-audit.json | jq '.broken_links, .hub_violations, .orphans'
# Expected: 0, 0, ≤5

# 4. Push and check CI
git push
# Expected: ✅ Lint and Validate workflow passes
```

---

## Root Causes

1. **Historical Commits:** Files committed before strict formatting rules were added
2. **No Local Pre-Commit:** Contributors not running pre-commit hooks locally
3. **Template Files:** AI-generated and manually-created files not validated
4. **Migration Documents:** Used visual formatting (underscores) for effect, not markdown compliance

---

## Prevention

### For Contributors

```bash
# Install pre-commit hook to catch issues before pushing
pre-commit install

# Test it works
git commit -m "test" --allow-empty
```

### For CI/CD

- Add pre-commit status check to branch protection rules
- Include formatting instructions in PR template
- Auto-comment on PRs with fix commands if pre-commit fails

---

## Configuration Issues Found

### 1. Deprecated Stage Names

**File:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (Lines 320, 327)

```yaml
# Current (deprecated)
default_stages: [commit, push]
stages: [commit]

# Fix
default_stages: [pre-commit, pre-push]
stages: [pre-commit]
```

### 2. Missing JSON Exclusions

**File:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (Line ~100)

Add generated files to exclusions:

```yaml
exclude: |
  (?x)^(
      # ... existing exclusions ...
      reports/generated/.*\.json$  # ← ADD THIS
  )$
```

### 3. Redundant Workflow Jobs

**File:** `.github/workflows/lint-and-validate.yml`

Jobs `markdown-lint` and `yaml-lint` are redundant (already in pre-commit).
**Recommendation:** Remove these jobs to simplify workflow.

**TL;DR:** Run `pre-commit run --all-files`, commit the changes, push. Fixed. ✅
