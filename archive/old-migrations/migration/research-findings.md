# Agent Skills Architecture Research Findings

**Research Date:** 2025-10-17
**Agent:** Researcher (swarm-1760669629248-p81glgo36)
**Objective:** Analyze Anthropic's Agent Skills format and determine transformation strategy for standards repository

---

## Executive Summary

Anthropic's Agent Skills format, launched October 2025, provides a structured approach for creating reusable, composable agent capabilities. The architecture uses progressive disclosure to minimize token consumption while maximizing agent autonomy and discoverability.

**Key Finding:** The williamzujkowski/standards repository is architecturally well-aligned for Skills transformation. The existing token optimization system (CLAUDE.md), modular standards structure, and product-matrix loading patterns map naturally to the Skills paradigm.

## 1. Agent Skills Architecture

### 1.1 Core Concept

Agent Skills are self-contained directories containing a `SKILL.md` file that teaches Claude how to perform specific tasks in a repeatable way. Skills use progressive disclosure to load only what's needed, when it's needed.

### 1.2 SKILL.md Structure

```yaml
---
name: skill-identifier-name
description: Clear description of what this skill does and when to use it (max 1024 chars)
---

# Skill Title

## Overview
Brief introduction to the skill's purpose and capabilities

## When to Use This Skill
- Specific trigger conditions
- Use case scenarios
- Decision criteria

## Core Instructions
Main procedural knowledge and workflow guidance

## Advanced Topics
References to additional files and resources:
- For [topic], see `./resources/detail.md`
- For templates, access `./templates/`
- For scripts, run `./scripts/tool.sh`

## Examples
Concrete usage examples demonstrating the skill in action
```

### 1.3 YAML Frontmatter Requirements

| Field | Constraint | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `name` | Max 64 characters, lowercase with hyphens | Unique skill identifier |
| `description` | Max 1024 characters | What the skill does AND when to use it |

**Critical:** These are the ONLY two supported frontmatter fields. No custom metadata is permitted.

---

## 2. Progressive Disclosure Pattern

### Level 1: Metadata (Always Loaded)

- **Token Cost:** ~100 per skill
- **Content:** Skill name and description only
- **Timing:** Loaded at agent startup into system prompt
- **Purpose:** Enable skill discovery without full context load

### Level 2: Instructions (Triggered Load)

- **Token Cost:** Target under 5,000 tokens
- **Content:** Full SKILL.md body with core instructions
- **Timing:** Loaded when Claude determines skill is relevant
- **Purpose:** Provide sufficient guidance without overwhelming context

### Level 3: Resources (On-Demand)

- **Token Cost:** Effectively unlimited (filesystem-based)
- **Content:** Reference materials, scripts, templates, documentation
- **Timing:** Loaded only when specifically referenced by Claude
- **Purpose:** Deep expertise without upfront token cost

**Design Philosophy:** Claude autonomously decides which skills to load based on task analysis. Skills provide "just enough information" at each level for effective decision-making.

## 3. Resource Bundling Patterns

### 3.1 Directory Organization

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md                    # Required: main skill definition
├── resources/                  # Optional: reference materials
│   ├── detailed-guide.md
│   ├── api-reference.md
│   └── troubleshooting.md
├── templates/                  # Optional: reusable templates
│   ├── config.template.yaml
│   └── boilerplate.template.py
├── scripts/                    # Optional: executable automation
│   ├── validate.sh
│   └── generate.py
└── examples/                   # Optional: concrete demonstrations
    ├── basic-usage/
    └── advanced-integration/
```

### 3.2 Supported Resource Types

- **Markdown files:** Instructions, references, guides
- **Executable scripts:** Bash, Python, Node.js (must use pre-installed packages)
- **Templates:** Configuration files, code scaffolding
- **Data files:** JSON, YAML, CSV for reference
- **API documentation:** OpenAPI specs, GraphQL schemas

### 3.3 Loading Mechanism

Skills use **filesystem-based loading** through Claude's file interaction capabilities:

- Read files with `Read` tool
- Execute scripts with `Bash` tool
- Search with `Glob` and `Grep` tools
- No external network access (pre-bundled resources only)

---

## 4. Token Optimization Strategies

### 4.1 Lazy Loading

Only load skill content when Claude determines relevance based on:

- Task description analysis
- User request patterns
- Skill description matching
- Context requirements

### 4.2 Minimal Core Instructions

Keep SKILL.md body under 5,000 tokens by:

- Moving detailed references to separate files
- Using script execution instead of inline code
- Linking to examples rather than embedding
- Providing conceptual guidance over exhaustive detail

### 4.3 Executable Resources

Scripts consume **zero context tokens** when:

- Stored as executable files in skill directory
- Called via Bash tool rather than inline
- Output captured and processed programmatically

### 4.4 Selective Context

Claude loads only required resources:

- Reads specific template when needed
- Accesses reference docs on-demand
- Executes validation scripts only when validating
- Never loads entire skill bundle at once

---

## 5. Skill Discovery and Triggering

### 5.1 Automatic Discovery

At startup, Claude pre-loads all skill names and descriptions into the system prompt, enabling:

- Autonomous skill selection based on task
- Multi-skill composition for complex workflows
- Context-aware capability matching
- Zero manual skill selection by user

### 5.2 Trigger Mechanisms

**Implicit Triggering (Preferred):**

```
User: "Create a secure REST API with authentication"
Claude: [Analyzes task] → [Loads api-design skill] → [Loads security-auth skill]
```

**Explicit Triggering:**

```
User: "Use the python-testing skill to add unit tests"
Claude: [Loads python-testing skill directly]
```

### 5.3 Multi-Skill Composition

Skills can reference and compose with other skills:

- Security skills integrate with language-specific skills
- Testing skills compose with framework skills
- Deployment skills layer over infrastructure skills

---

## 6. Deployment Locations

### 6.1 Claude Code

```
~/.claude/skills/              # Global skills (all projects)
<project>/.claude/skills/      # Project-specific skills
<plugin>/skills/               # Plugin-bundled skills
```

### 6.2 Claude.ai

- Available to Pro and Team plans
- Skills uploaded via web interface
- Shared across conversations in account

### 6.3 Claude API

- Skills provided in API request context
- Can be cached for multi-turn efficiency
- Supports dynamic skill loading

---

## 7. Best Practices for Skill Authoring

### 7.1 Description Quality

**Strong Description:**

```yaml
description: Creates production-ready Python REST APIs with FastAPI, including authentication, input validation, error handling, and OpenAPI documentation. Use when building new API services or standardizing existing ones.
```

**Weak Description:**

```yaml
description: Helps with Python API development.
```

**Key Elements:**

- What: Specific capability being provided
- How: Key techniques or frameworks used
- When: Clear trigger conditions for usage
- Why: Value proposition or outcome

### 7.2 Modular Design

- One skill per focused capability
- Compose multiple skills for complex tasks
- Avoid mega-skills that try to do everything
- Clear boundaries between related skills

### 7.3 Progressive Detail

- **SKILL.md:** Conceptual framework and decision guidance
- **Resources:** Detailed implementation references
- **Scripts:** Automation of repetitive operations
- **Examples:** Concrete demonstrations of usage

### 7.4 Clear Navigation

Provide explicit pointers to additional resources:

```markdown
## Advanced Topics

For detailed API patterns, see `./resources/api-patterns.md`
For database integration, see `./resources/database-integration.md`
To generate boilerplate, run `./scripts/generate-api.sh [name]`
For complete examples, explore `./examples/`
```

## 9. Standards Repository Analysis

### 9.1 Current Architecture Strengths

**Token Optimization System:**

- CLAUDE.md already implements selective loading with @load patterns
- 90% token reduction achieved through smart bundling
- Product-matrix.yaml provides structured standard discovery
- Natural alignment with Skills' progressive disclosure

**Modular Standards Structure:**

- 25+ focused standard documents in docs/standards/
- Each standard is self-contained and reusable
- Clear categorical organization (security, testing, coding, etc.)
- Natural mapping to individual skills

**Resource Bundling:**

- NIST templates, scripts, and VS Code extension
- Example projects and configurations
- Automation scripts for validation and generation
- All pre-bundled and ready for filesystem access

### 9.2 Natural Skill Boundaries

| Current Standard | Target Skill(s) | Rationale |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| CODING_STANDARDS.md | language-specific skills (python/, javascript/, go/) | Each language becomes a focused skill |
| MODERN_SECURITY_STANDARDS.md | security-auth/, zero-trust/, threat-modeling/ | Split by security domain |
| TESTING_STANDARDS.md | unit-testing/, integration-testing/, e2e-testing/ | Separate by testing level |
| NIST compliance system | nist-compliance/ | Bundle templates, scripts, SSP generator as single skill |
| DEVOPS_PLATFORM_STANDARDS.md | ci-cd/, infrastructure/, deployment/ | Split by DevOps phase |
| CLOUD_NATIVE_STANDARDS.md | kubernetes/, containers/, serverless/ | One skill per cloud-native pattern |
| FRONTEND_MOBILE_STANDARDS.md | react/, vue/, mobile-ios/, mobile-android/ | Framework-specific skills |

### 9.3 Transformation Requirements

**Structural Changes:**

1. Create `skills/` directory at repository root
2. Transform each standard into a skill directory with SKILL.md
3. Migrate CLAUDE.md loading logic into skill-loader/ meta-skill
4. Bundle related templates/scripts into skill directories
5. Create skill composition patterns for multi-standard projects

**Content Adaptations:**

1. Extract YAML frontmatter (name + description) for each skill
2. Restructure content to follow Level 1/2/3 disclosure pattern
3. Split large standards into focused sub-skills
4. Create navigation between related skills
5. Convert automation to executable scripts

**Backward Compatibility:**

1. Maintain original standards in archive/ for reference
2. Create legacy-bridge/ skill for old @load pattern mapping
3. Update product-matrix.yaml to reference new skills
4. Provide migration guide for existing users
5. Gradual deprecation timeline for old structure
