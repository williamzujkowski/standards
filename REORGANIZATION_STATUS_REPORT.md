# Standards Repository Reorganization - Final Status Report

**Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Branch**: review_and_overhaul  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE WITH ENHANCEMENTS

## Executive Summary

Successfully reorganized the standards repository according to the specifications in `prompt.md` and `plan.md`. The repository now features a clean, LLM-friendly structure with authoritative content from primary sources, comprehensive CI/CD workflows, and proper metadata throughout.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Repository Structure Reorganization

**Created new directory structure:**

```
/standards/
  ├── nist/          # NIST standards (SP 800-53, 800-171, 800-218)
  ├── owasp/         # OWASP standards (Top 10 2021)
  ├── supply-chain/  # Supply chain security (SLSA 1.0)
  ├── cisa/          # CISA guidance (pending)
  └── _templates/    # Standard templates
```

**Archived old reports:**

- Moved `*_REPORT.md` files to `/archive/reports/`
- Preserved for reference but removed from root clutter
