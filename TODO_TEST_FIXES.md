# TODO: Test Suite Fixes

This document tracks all issues identified by our test suite that need to be fixed to achieve full compliance with KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT_STANDARDS.md.

## üß™ Test Suite Execution

### Pre-fix Baseline
- [ ] Run full test suite and capture baseline results
  ```bash
  python3 tests/validate_cross_references.py > test_results_baseline.txt 2>&1
  python3 lint/standards-linter.py > lint_results_baseline.txt 2>&1
  ```

## üîß Critical Fixes (Errors)

### 1. MANIFEST.yaml Completeness
- [ ] Add UNIFIED_STANDARDS.md entry to MANIFEST.yaml
  ```yaml
  UNIFIED:
    identifier: "UNIFIED"
    full_name: "UNIFIED_STANDARDS.md"
    size: "45KB"
    token_estimate: 12000
    sections:
      overview:
        tokens: 500
        priority: "critical"
        description: "Comprehensive overview"
    dependencies:
      requires: []
      recommends: ["CS", "TS", "SEC"]
  ```

### 2. Missing Metadata Headers (20 files)

- [ ] Add link from MANIFEST.yaml references back to KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT_STANDARDS.md
- [ ] Add link from CLAUDE.md back to KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT_STANDARDS.md

### 8. Code Block Language Specifiers
Add language specifiers to all code blocks (``` ‚Üí ```language):
- [ ] Review all standards files and add appropriate language specifiers

### 9. Implementation Checklists
Add implementation checklists to files missing them:
- [ ] Review each standard and add an "## Implementation Checklist" section

### 10. Standard Codes
Add Standard Code metadata to files missing them:
- [ ] Assign 2-4 letter codes to each standard file

## üìä Post-Fix Validation

### Final Testing
- [ ] Run full test suite after fixes
  ```bash
  python3 tests/validate_cross_references.py > test_results_final.txt 2>&1
  python3 lint/standards-linter.py > lint_results_final.txt 2>&1
  ```
- [ ] Compare baseline vs final results
- [ ] Ensure all errors are resolved
- [ ] Document any remaining warnings that are acceptable

### Quality Checks
- [ ] Run pre-commit hooks on all changes
  ```bash
  pre-commit run --all-files
  ```
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with fixes applied
- [ ] Create PR with all fixes

## üéØ Success Criteria

- All error-level issues resolved
- Warning count reduced by >80%
- All tests passing in CI/CD
- Pre-commit hooks passing

## üìù Notes

- Some warnings may be acceptable (e.g., very long reference sections)
- Token efficiency warnings are informational only
- Focus on errors first, then high-impact warnings
- Use `python3 tests/fix_validation_issues.py` for automated fixes where possible
