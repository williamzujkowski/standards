## üöÄ Quick Start

### For New Projects

1. Start with **UNIFIED_STANDARDS.md** - Your comprehensive foundation
2. Review **CLAUDE.md** - Understand the efficient routing system
3. Select domain-specific standards based on your tech stack
4. Implement using provided templates and checklists

### For Existing Projects

1. Perform gap analysis using relevant standard checklists
2. Prioritize implementation based on:
   - Security standards (MODERN_SECURITY_STANDARDS.md)
   - Testing standards (TESTING_STANDARDS.md)
   - Core coding standards (CODING_STANDARDS.md)
3. Gradually adopt other standards based on project needs

### For LLM/AI Usage

Use **CLAUDE.md** as your routing document to load only relevant standards:
```
@load [CS:style,architecture + TS:core + SEC:auth]
```

## ü§ñ LLM Optimization

### The CLAUDE.md Advantage

Our innovative routing system reduces token usage by 85% when using these standards with LLMs:

1. **Efficient Loading**: Load only what you need
   ```
   @load [CS:api-design + SEC:api-security + TS:integration]
   ```

2. **Task-Based Templates**: Pre-configured for common tasks
   ```
   Bug Fix: @load [TS:regression + CS:error-handling]
   New Feature: @load [CS:architecture + TS:tdd + SEC:relevant]
   ```

3. **Smart Routing**: 2-letter codes for all standards
   ```
   CS ‚Üí CODING_STANDARDS.md
   SEC ‚Üí MODERN_SECURITY_STANDARDS.md
   PM ‚Üí PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_STANDARDS.md
   ```

### Benefits

- **Cost Reduction**: 85% fewer tokens = lower API costs
- **Faster Responses**: Less context = quicker processing
- **Better Accuracy**: Focused context = more relevant outputs
- **Scalability**: Efficient even with all 20 standards available
